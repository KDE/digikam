       <title>About &showfoto;</title>

       <para>
       &showfoto; is a fast Image Editor with a few basic yet powerful image editing tools. You can use it to view your photographs and make corrections and alterations.

       <sect2>
       <title>Reporting Bugs</title>

       <para>
       Like the rest of KDE, &showfoto; is an Open Source project. This means that it relies on its users to play their part by, at least, reporting problems and suggesting possible improvements.
       </para>

       <para>
       &showfoto; makes it as easy as possible for you to report bugs or suggest improvements. Wherever you are in the application the Help menu will include a Report Bugs option. This will display a message box with a highlighted link. Click on the link and your web browser will open the page for the reporting system. All the information required will already be filled in, just follow the instructions for completing your report.
       </para>
       </sect2>

       <sect2>
       <title>Support</title>
      
       <para>
       &showfoto; is a community supported project, which means that users and developers support one another. If you become a regular user of &showfoto; you are encouraged to join the &showfoto; Users Mailing List. You can start off by asking questions of other &showfoto; users and hopefully soon you will be answering the support questions of others.

       <title>Getting Involved</title>

       <para>
       There are many ways that you can get involved with the continued development of &showfoto;. You do not need to be a software developer. You can help with documentation, translation and user interface design or just contribute really good ideas to the wish-list. You can also get involved by testing early development code as it is being developed and providing feedback to the developers. Of course, if you are a software developer then you can help to make &showfoto; the best digital photograph application there is. 
       </para>

       <para>
       The best way to start getting involved with &showfoto; is to join the Developers Mailing List.

    <title>Supported Image File Formats</title>

        <sect2>
        <title>Still Photograph Formats</title>

        <para>
        Almost all digital cameras store photographs in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. Many cameras enable you to select which of these formats to use. JPEG is a compressed format, that trades some of the image quality to keep file sizes small. TIFF is not a compressed format, it maintains higher image quality but at the expense of much larger file sizes. A full description of these formats can be found at the <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_file_format">Wikipedia</ulink>. &showfoto; supports both of these formats.
        </para>

        <para>
        PNG is an image format that was developed as a replacement for a number of older, in the 1990's widely used, image file formats. It is a lossless format like TIFF but it is much more compact and can save you disk space. Although your camera is unlikely to support PNG, some people like to convert their photographs to PNG as soon as they get them on their computer. Unlike JPEG, PNG images do not loose quality every time you re-encode them after alteration. For more information about the PNG format see the <ulink url="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">PNG homepage</ulink>.
        </para>

        </sect2>

        <sect2>
        <title>How &showfoto; Supports File Formats</title>

        <para>
        &showfoto; relies on a number of libraries and support packages to load and save image formats. Which image formats are available will depend on the availability of these libraries on your system and, in some cases, on the way that those libraries have been compiled. On most distributions you will find that a wide range of image formats are viewable within &showfoto;.
        </para>

        <para>
        This dependence on other libraries means that it is not possible to give a definitive list of all of the formats that will be available on your system. At the very least JPEG, PNG, and TIFF will be available.
        </para>

    <sect1 id="using-kapp-pluginssupport">
    <title>Supported Plugins</title>

        <para>
        One of the nicest things about &showfoto; is how easily its functionality can be extended, by using <emphasis>digiKam Image Editor Plugins</emphasis>: these plugins add new image manipulation options. The <ulink url="http://extragear.kde.org/apps/digikamimageplugins">DigikamImagePlugins project</ulink> is dedicated to providing a collection of tools using this architecture. Image Editor Plugins setup is described in this <link linkend="setupplugins">section</link>.
        </para>

                                    
        <para>
        Plugins can manipulate images in almost any way that users can. Their advantage is, that it is much easier to add a capability to &showfoto; by writing a small plugin than by modifying the &showfoto; core.

            <para>
            &showfoto; provides a number of tools that enable you to adjust a photograph. Some of these tools are provided by plugins to &showfoto;. So they may not be available by default on your distribution. See the <link linkend="setupplugins">Setup Plugins Section</link> for more details about &showfoto; plugins.

            <para>
            The editing functions of the Image Editor will make changes to your photograph. None of the editing functions will change the original photograph unless you select 
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
            or click the <guilabel>Save</guilabel> button in the Tool Bar. Note that once you have saved the changed version you will not be able to recover the original photograph.
            </para>
        
            <para>
            You might prefer to take a copy of your photograph before you make any changes. You can use 
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Save As</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
            to save a working copy.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            At any time <emphasis>before</emphasis> you save your photograph you can restore the view to the original image by selecting 
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Revert</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
            or clicking the 
            <inlinemediaobject>

                <textobject><phrase>The Image Editor Revert Button</phrase></textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject>
            <guilabel>Revert</guilabel> button on the Tool Bar. You will loose any changes that you have made to the photograph since it was last saved.
            </para>

        <sect2>
        <title>Undoing/Redoing Actions</title>
            
            <para>
            Almost anything you do to an image in Image Editor can be undone/redone. You can undo the most recent action by choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Undo</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, and redo by <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Redo</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
            </para>
            
            <para>
            If these are done so frequently that you really should memorize the keyboard shortcuts, <guilabel>Ctrl-Z</guilabel> to undoing action, and <guilabel>Ctrl-Shift-Z</guilabel> to redoing action.
            </para>

            <para>
            To  get a popup menu with the available undo/redo actions, you have to press the left mouse button at the undo or redo icon in the toolbar and hold it down for a moment. If you choose one of the menu items, all undo/redo actions until the choosen one are done.

            <para>
            Once you have started the Image Editor with several images at once you can move between photographs by using the navigator buttons on the Tool Bar or the entries in the <guilabel>File</guilabel> menu. If you show the thumbnail bar you can also navigate by clicking the thumbnails. When you have made any changes to the current photograph you will be asked if you want to save them.

        <title>Changing the View</title>

            <para>
            You can zoom in and out of a photograph using the

            </inlinemediaobject> buttons on the Tool Bar or the entries in the View menu. 
            To make a photograph fit into the window use the <guilabel>Zoom Autofit</guilabel>

            <para>
            <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Toggle Full Screen</guimenuitem></menuchoice> will display the photograph using the full screen mode. You can move back to the normal view by pressing the <keycombo><keycap>Esc</keycap></keycombo> key. By default the Tool Bar is still displayed even in Full Screen Mode. If you would prefer that the Tool Bar is not displayed you can turn it off in the Configure &showfoto; dialog accessed from the main &showfoto; window, see the <link linkend="setupgeneral">Setup General Section</link>.

                    EXIF stands for <emphasis>EXtended Interchange Format</emphasis>. It was designed specifically for digital cameras. It allows a large amount of information about the photograph to be stored. Those informations are describing the camera which took the image along with the settings (including date and time) in use when the picture was taken. Also it allows an inline thumbnail to be included.

                An image can be decomposed into <guilabel>Red</guilabel>, <guilabel>Green</guilabel>, <guilabel>Blue</guilabel>, <guilabel>Alpha</guilabel> color channels. <guilabel>Alpha</guilabel> channel is a Layer in the image that supports transparency (like PNG or GIF images). Each channel supports a range of intensity levels from 0 to 255 (integer valued). Thus, a black pixel is encoded by 0 on all color channels; a white pixel by 255 on all color channels. A transparent pixel is encoded by 0 on the alpha channel; an opaque pixel by 255.

                    Aspect Ratio Crop tool goes further. While you are editing digital images, it is often necessary to create a compatible format with, for example, your photo-album. If you print an image from your digital camera and then try to put it in your photo album, you may notice that the camera has a different width or height ratio than a normal photographic film format so you need to crop your digital images in a predefined ratio (for example 5:7 or 2:3 which is a standard photo ratio).

                    <guilabel>Show Rule of Thirds Lines</guilabel> line option is a guiding element to better compose your images. This guide is a grid that divides the picture into thirds in every direction (that makes for 9 parts). These proportions are close to the golden rule and are derived from the field of view of the human eye. They are used, often with slight variations throughout a large number of commonly used objects. Within that frame there are precise areas where the important parts of the image should be placed. The same principle is used to determine the position of the horizon and the proportion of ground to sky.

                    When first looking at an image, the eye of the viewer rarely settles at the centre of the image, but instead from the top left to right, and then to the lower left and right again. This pattern is most unconscious but has been well-documented. It is probably associated with the western reading pattern. From the photographer's point of view, the goal then becomes to guide the gaze of the viewer to the subject, being aware of the way many people perceive an image.

The red is the reflection from the back the eye which can be seen because the pupil can not react quickly enough to the flash.

                If the camera focus is not set perfectly or if the camera is moving when the picture is taken the result is a blurred photograph. If there is a lot of blurring, you probably won't be able to do much about it with any technique. If there is only a moderate amount, you should be able to improve the picture.

                You should be careful with this though, or the results will not look very natural: sharpening increases the apparent sharpness of edges in the photograph, but also amplifies noise.

                <para>
                When you take a photograph in low-light conditions or with a very fast exposure time, the camera does not get enough data to make good estimates of the true color at each pixel, and consequently the resulting photograph looks grainy. You can "smooth out" the graininess by blurring the image, but then you will also lose sharpness. Probably the best approaches, if the graininess is not too bad, is to use the Noise Reduction filter.

            If your image is washed out (which can easily happen when you take pictures in bright light) try the Hue/Saturation/Lightness tool, which gives you three sliders to manipulate, for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Raising the saturation will probably make the image look better. In some cases, it is useful to adjust the lightness at the same time. ("Lightness" here is similar to "Brightness" in the Brightness/Contrast/Gamma tool, except that they are formed from different combinations of the red, green, and blue channels).

When you are happy with the results, press <guilabel>Ok</guilabel> and they will take effect.

                <guilabel>Normalize</guilabel>: this method scales brightness values across the selected image so that the darkest point becomes black, and the brightest point becomes as bright as possible without altering its hue. This is often a "magic fix" for images that are dim or washed out.

                <guilabel>Equalize</guilabel>: this method adjusts the brightness of colors across the selected image so that the histogram for the Value channel is as flat as possible, that is, so that each possible brightness value appears at about the same number of pixels as each other value. Sometimes Equalize works wonderfully at enhancing the contrasts of an image. Other times it gives garbage. It is a very powerful operation, which can either work miracles on a picture or destroy it.

            The simplest tool to use is the Brightness/Contrast/Gamma tool. It is also the least powerful, but in many cases it does everything you need. This tool is often useful for images that are overexposed or underexposed; it is not useful for correcting color casts. The tool gives you three sliders to adjust, for "Brightness", "Contrast" and "Gamma". You can see any adjustments you make reflected in the preview image. When you are happy with the results, press <guilabel>Ok</guilabel> and they will take effect.

            If you have the Adjust Levels plugin installed (see the <link linkend="setupplugins">Setup Plugins Section</link>) you will have additional entry in the Fix menu called

            <guimenuitem>Levels Adjust</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. This tool provides an integrated way of seeing the results of adjusting multiple levels and also enables you to save level settings for application to multiple photographs. This can be useful if your camera or scanner often makes the same mistakes and you want to apply the same corrections.

            A very powerful way of correcting exposure problems is to use the Adjust Curves plugin available by <menuchoice><guimenu>Fix</guimenu><guimenuitem>Colors</guimenuitem>
            <guimenuitem>Curves Adjust</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu entry. This tool allows you to click and drag control points on a curve to create a free function mapping input brightness levels to output brightness levels. The Curves tool can replicate any effect you can achieve with Brightness/Contrast/Gamma or the Adjust Levels plugin, though it is more powerful than either one of them. Once again, we refer you to the <ulink url="help:/digikamimageplugins/adjustcurves.html">Adjust Curves manual</ulink> for more detailed instructions, but the easiest way to learn how to use it is by experimenting. 
            
	    But this plugin can do more for you, it helps you to improve the tonal quality of your photographs to very finely stepped gray scales. And don't forget that the better the photographs are (good exposure, lossless format, 24 or 32 bit deep) the more you can improve them. Navigate to the "Achieving ultimate tonal quality" section of this instructive page: <ulink url="http://www.normankoren.com/digital_tonality.html">Tonal quality and dynamic range in digital cameras by Norman Koren</ulink>. Use digiKam Adjust Curves to do just the same!

            By default &showfoto; provides a couple of simple toning filters that you can use on your photographs. Under the Filters menu you will find classic Black and White chemical toning used in analog photography. Color toning changes the monochromatic tint of a basically black and white photograph. When applied it gives the picture a warm, antique feeling. Some examples of colors toning types available in &showfoto; are listed below:

            When changes are made to JPEG files and they are saved back to the hard disk the JPEG file must be re-encoded. Each time a JPEG file is encoded a decision must be made on the level of quality that is to be applied. Unfortunately the level of quality applied is not recorded in the image file. This means that &showfoto; cannot use the same quality ratio when saving an altered image as was used for the original image. You can change the default level of quality that &showfoto; will apply when it saves altered images by moving the <guilabel>JPEG quality</guilabel> slider  (1: low quality / 100: high quality and no compression).

            With <guilabel>PNG compression</guilabel> option, you can reduce PNG image files size. This operation doesn't reduce image quality because PNG usees a lossless algorithm. The only effect is that image data needs more time to compress/decompress. If you have a fast computer you can change this value for to use a high compression factor (1: low compression / 9: high compression).
