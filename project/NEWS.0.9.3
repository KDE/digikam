digiKam 0.9.3 - Release date: 2007-12-23

NEW FEATURES:

AlbumGUI

Drag&Drop      : D&D from anywhere into album tree. When the albumview is flattened
                 (Include Album Sub-tree) images can be d&ded across horizontal separations.
                 That one satisfies wish #142774.

Goto           : A new quick navigation feature has been added: it is now possible (by RMB context menu)
                 to GOTO any other view with pertinent context, e.g. from date view right-click on an
                 image and GOTO the Album or Tag view that this image is associated with.
                 Try any other combination.
                 That covers wish #128231.

AlbumGUI       : Always force to show mediaplayer widget to preview video in embeded mode.
