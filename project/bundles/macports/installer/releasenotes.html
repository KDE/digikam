<h1>Thank you for installing digiKam!</h1>

We would like to inform you that port of digiKam under MacOS is not as stable as the Linux version.

digiKam works mostly fine under MacOS, but some features are still missing due to not yet 
implemented features in the underlying <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE.org</a> libraries, even if since 
digiKam 5.0.0 release, the dependencies to this framework have been seriously reduced. 

This installer has been compiled using the <a href="https://www.macports.org/">Macports project</a>.

<h1>Licence</h1>

digiKam is an open-source project published under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0">General Public Licence</a> version 2 or later.

<h1>Internationalization</h1>

This installer includes a lot of application translations. To change current language,
go to the Help menu and use the Switch Application Language option. digiKam needs to be restarted for this to take effect.

<h1>Documentation</h1>

To limit the size of this bundle, the large digiKam documentation is not included. The complete handbook is available online 
<a href="https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/extragear-graphics/digikam/index.html">as HTML</a> or 
<a href="https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/extragear-graphics/digikam/digikam.pdf">as PDF</a>.

<h1>Requirements and Limitations</h1>

Internal database server required to install locally a database backend for MacOS, as <a href="https://www.mysql.com/downloads/">Mysql</a> or <a href="https://downloads.mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a>.

Camera auto detection does not work yet as under Linux due to limitations in <a href="https://solid.kde.org">Solid hardware interface</a> used by digiKam.

Panorama and ExpoBlending tools require to install <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin runtime components</a> to process files.
