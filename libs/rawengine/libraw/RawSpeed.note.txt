If you want to import RawSpeed into rawengine, follow these instructions :

  - Fetch RawSpeed source code http://rawstudio.org/svn/rawspeed/ using right svn revision 'REV' tested properly with LibRaw.

    > svn checkout http://rawstudio.org/svn/rawspeed/@REV RawSpeed

  - Copy all source code from RawSpeed sub-dir

  - Apply these patches from LibRaw to RawSpeed source code :
    * rawspeed.cpucount-unix.patch.

  - Remove these files from RawSpeed :
    * RawSpeed.cpp (it is test application source).
    * FileReader.cpp/h (LibRaw uses own LibRaw_datastream).
    * RawSpeed.vcproj (MSVC project).

  - From RawSpeed project, get camera.xml data file and run over script rsxml2c.sh from LibRaw
    to make RawSpeed/rawspeed_xmldata.cpp from it :

    > ./rsxml2c.sh camera.xml > rawspeed_xmldata.cpp

  - Apply crlf2lf.sh script to patch EOF in all source code files.
