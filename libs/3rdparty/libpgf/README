Version 6.12.24, (Thu, 14 June 2012) 
 
Release Notes
-------------
 
1. The new version is a replacement of version 6.11.42. 
   In case you use the ROI encoding scheme, we strongly encourage using version 6.12.24 instead of version 6.11.42.
 
2. This version fixes some decoder bugs, sometimes seen in ROI decoding.
 
3. This version allows a simpler user-data handling, especially for uncached metadata. The following two methods
   in the class PGFimage are designed for this purpose:

	GetUserDataPos() returns in an opened PGF image the stream position of the user data area.								

	WriteImage() encodes and writes the image at the current stream position. This method is called after
	WriteHeader(). In case you want to write uncached metadata into the stream, then do that after WriteHeader() 
	and just before WriteImage(). If you are not interested in writing uncached metadata, then you usually use
	Write() instead of WriteImage(). WriteHeader() and WriteImage() are called inside of Write().
