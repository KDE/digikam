The authentication fails with uploading media although
we are using the o2 library which has a class specific for twitter authentication.
Posting tweets authenticates and passes using the same library.
Need to see twitter community response on this problem. ---> RESOLVED

Replace current method for uploading media in twittertalker.cpp by uploading by chunks
