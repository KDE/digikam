NOTE: this tool was originally developped during the GoSC2011.

-- Dependencies --

 * Various tools from the hugin project (developement is based on version 2011.0, FIXME: may work with earlier versions).
 * Enblend

-- Data Input --

This tool takes several images taken from the same point of view, either RAW images, TIFF images or JPEG images.

Throughout the process, project files (i.e. dot pto files) are analyzed and modified with GNU Flex and GNU Bison.

-- Processing --

The panorama workflow is the following:

 1) RAW images are converted to TIFF images
 2) A pto file (hugin project file) is generated with parameters to be optimized
 3) Control points are calculated to match overlaps between images (using cpfind from the hugin project)
 4) Then C.P. that are clearly wrong matches are deleted (using cpclean from the hugin project)
 5) Optimization of positions and photometric parameters are performed (using autooptimise from the hugin project)
 6) A Makefile which will perform the stitching is generated (using pto2mk from the hugin project)
 7) The Makefile is run (uses nona from the hugin project, and enblend)

All images are supposed to be taken from the same point of view, and with the same camera and lens.

-- Stitching Parameters --

 * Celeste Filter (cpfind): detects clouds and dismiss control points associated to those
