2009-06-07 16:26  aclemens

    * libs/widgets/common/manualrenameinput.cpp: Optimizing the parser
      a little bit.
      It is always a good idea to move variable creation out of loops,
      to
      speed up the algorithm a little and save us from constructing /
      destructing the object all the time.

      Now that the stars are shown whenever the item is entered, we
      dont need

      libs/models/imagefiltermodel.cpp,
      libs/models/imagefiltermodelpriv.h, libs/models/imagemodel.cpp,
      libs/models/imagemodel.h: When ImageInfos where processed by the
      preprocessor and an incremental update was started,
      the infos on the road were not recognized. For incremental
      updates we need to wait
      for all infos to be readded to have a clean state.
      As a second bug, in slotCollectionImageChange albumIds were taken
      from the image ids so that
      no update was started when an image was added to a PAlbum.

      libs/database/imagequerybuilder.cpp: polish queries

2009-06-06 11:28  aclemens

    * libs/database/albumdb.cpp, libs/database/imagelister.cpp: LEFT
      OUTER JOIN is the same as LEFT JOIN.
      Since we use LEFT JOIN more often, unify the queries to avoid
      confusion.

      We need to check if all LEFT JOINs are really needed.

2009-06-06 11:27  aclemens

    * libs/database/albumdb.cpp: Every image / item has
      ImageInformation, so INNER JOIN should be enough.

2009-06-06 09:30  aclemens

    * libs/database/albumdb.cpp: According to some dev from the sqlite
      IRC channel, it is always better to
      tell sqlite exactly what you want to do, otherwise it might try
      to
      optimize a query in a wrong way. If you want to use a normal
      INNER JOIN,
      tell sqlite explicitly to do so.

    * libs/threadimageio/test/pgfscaled.cpp: polish

2009-06-06 08:14  aclemens

    * libs/database/imagelister.cpp: same here: Every image will have
      some ImageInformation and also every
      image with a status=1 will have an album assigned to it. LEFT
      OUTER JOIN
      is not needed in that case.

2009-06-06 08:14  aclemens

    * libs/database/imagelister.cpp: a normal JOIN should be enough
      here, every image will have
      ImageInformation in the database, at least the creation date and
      the
      format is always known.
      Therefore the images table doesn't have to be always fully
      returned.

2009-06-05 21:12  aclemens

    * libs/database/albumdb.cpp: Use normal (INNER) JOINs to speed up
      the query

2009-06-05 20:59  aclemens

    * libs/database/albumdb.cpp: Use a normal JOIN here, this will
      greatly improve speed, especially when
      called multiple times, like we do in batchthumbnailgenerator.

      In my (extreme) test case the thumbnails dialog was filled in
      only 2
      seconds instead of 3 minutes!!! (:-))

      I will check further queries in the database model to see if we
      can
      improve speed there.

    * libs/models/imagesortsettings.cpp: For the sorting by tags and by
      image size many images can in fact have the same sorting value
      (imagine an album without any rated image sorted by rating. The
      last sorting will be used,
      because I think a stablesort is applied. This may be desirable,
      but there may be no last
      sorting at all, in this case sorting is random / by image id)
      In the case of equal values by rating or by image size, use the
      file name for sorting.
      Need second-order sorting be configurable?

      digikam/ratingwidget.h: Display rating widget when mouse is over
      icon view item. By this way:
      - user can always see where he can click to change rating,
      especially with unrated item.
      - behavour is the same than select/rotate buttons over icon view
      item. It's homogeneous.

      With previous behavour, rating widget been displayed only when
      mouse is over rating widget area.
      User need to discover this feature by searching area. Now, it's
      more intuitive.

    * libs/database/albumdb.cpp: If the format string is empty, don't
      add it to the map. Nobody will ever
      know what format is listed and therefore it doesn't make much
      sense to
      add it at all.
      Anyway an empty format should never appear in the query, but just
      to be
      sure we should continue in this case.

      Thanks to Stefano Rivoir for the tip (damn, used GROUP BY a lot
      in some

      Marcel,

      I removed the code under FIXME now, since you said it is not

      libs/imageproperties/imagedescedittab.cpp: remove RatingBox
      widget. Use RatingWidget instead everywhere.
      RatingWidget has now a fading mode to display progressively
      widget
      This mode is used in new icon-view based on Model View to switch
      is edit mode when
      user move mouse over the widget.
      During fading, widget appear and rating cannot be edited. fading
      duration is 1500ms.
      This will prevent unwanted rating assignation to item when user
      move mouse over the item to
      just only select it.
      To really want to change rating to item, user need to stay over
      rating widget more than
      fading duration.
      This patch only change this behavour in iconview, not with
      thummbar. Thumbbar is not yet
      ported to Model/View, but when it will done, we will use same
      component than iconview and
      problem will be fixed automatically there.

      We want a selected item so that the right sidebar and the

      It's a bit complex because the index at (0,0) can change while
      loading
      2) When changing the filter, we also want at least one item
      selected if an
      item was selected previously. Restructured code.
      It worked for me before, but not for Andi.

      Marcel, Gilles,

      there is some query in the function that doesn't seem to do
      anything. Is
      this old code? I have commented it for now.

      Statistics seems to work fine for images now, but somehow I get
      12
      movies more in another test database, as when I recursively
      display the
      movie folder.

      Need to check if it is a problem with my DB.

    * digikam/kcategorizedview.cpp, digikam/kcategorizedview_p.h:
      Optimization part 3.
      - QList can be inefficient for QModelIndex - in fact it will call
      new/delete for every single insertion
      or deletion, which makes complexity O(n). QVector is O(1).
      Use QVector for storing indexes
      - elementsInfo is always completely filled and size is known in
      advance. No need for a hash, QVector is fine.
      - for non-uniformItemSizes, store at least the view options when
      iterating. This does not affect us anymore in
      digikam but viewOptions() was initially the no.1 cost

      Combine the branches for uniformItemSizes/non-uniform sizes
      again.

    * libs/widgets/imageplugins/imageguidewidget.cpp: Use the guide
      size for the line thickness in the freerotation tool.
      Sometimes it is handy to change the guide color and the thickness
      so
      that you can distinguish the guide a little bit better from the
      rest of
      the image. If you need a bigger guide size, it is most common
      that you
      also need a thicker line in the freerotation tool, to see where
      you set
      the auto-correct points.

      freerotation tool, too.
      Makes it much more space saving on smaller screens.

      Gilles, Marcel and others,
      we should consider to use this in every plugin... what do you
      think?
      It is much more readable then those ugly vertical tabs (toolbox
      widget)
      we use in some places.

    * digikam/contextmenuhelper.cpp: It is more visible to use icons in
      the context menu, especially with our
      quite big contextmenu, entries can get lost quite easy.
      I added the tag icon for the "assign tag" / "remove tag" actions.

      What do you think?
      I think it helps a lot to identify those entries now.

      new DExpanderBox widget to host DExpanderLabel like QToolBox do.
      The goal is to use DExpanderBox instead QToolBox as well, with a
      similar API.
      This widget is now used in camera gui settings area.
      Later KDE 4.3 branching, i will move clicklabel widgets to
      libkdcraw to use it in Raw decoding settings widget.
      Also, we will able to use it in kipi-plugins if necessary.
      I plan to use this widget in others place in digiKam, as CM tool,
      Ratio-crop, etc...

      clean up the actions and handle the deletion of the
      popmenu like this?
      As I wrote this, I borrowed it from some old contextmenu code,
      but I
      guess it is not needed. Valgrind shows no leaks either.
      I disable it for now for testing purposes. If all is fine, I will
      remove
      it completely later on.

      Hope MSVC is happy now.

    * digikam/metadatamanager.cpp, digikam/metadatamanager.h,
      digikam/metadatamanager_p.h: The last missing major piece of
      functionality for DigikamImageView is assigning tags/rating
      including writing metadata for multiple images. This is done in
      the event loop thread
      using kapp->processEvents() in AlbumIconView, which is known to
      be potentially evil.
      MetadataManager provides a simple API for these operations and
      executes them in threads,
      one thread for db operations, one thread for file metadata
      writing. Dispatching is done
      by signals (this is a possible use case for QtConcurrent as well.
      I'm currently not very familiar with that API though).
      Attempt at reporting progress as a summary. Needs testing.

      visual rect
      and adjusts the view's selection.

2009-04-30 17:53  mwiesweg

    * digikam/imagedelegateoverlay.cpp, digikam/imagedelegateoverlay.h:
      ImageDelegateOverlay is the concept of "overlaying" functionality
      over the drawing of the image
      view delegate. Think of the selection toggle button and the
      in-place rating edit box.
      An overlay can extend the delegate's painting or install its own
      widget, and can receive
      selected events and signals from the view. Overlays can be added
      and removed on a view anytime.
      I hope it allows to implement a bit more functionality on the
      view in the future.

2009-04-30 17:53  mwiesweg

    * libs/widgets/common/itemviewhoverbutton.cpp,

      item view.
      Speaking clearly, it is Peter Penz's great Dolphin
      SelectionToggle not confined to selection icons.
      Allows the same toggleSelect button as we had in IconView but
      with animation.

      Sometimes you want to go to a tag that is not a child / endpoint
      in the
      tag hierarchy.
      For example:

      You are watching images that contain animal tags, some of them
      are
      specific (dog, cat, horse), but some animals have no specific
      description tag.

      Animals
      Animals/Dog
      Animals/Cat
      Animals/Horse

      You are not able to go to animals with the current
      implementation. This
      patch fixes the problem.

      Any idea how to make this look nicer? I tried to use
      label->setEnabled(false), but this isn't helping either. Most of
      the
      digiKam themes seem to ignore this setting.

      So removing it seems to be the best way.

    * digikam/imagedelegate.cpp, digikam/imagedelegate.h: Make spacing
      and grid size work.
      Calculate sizes in delegate and emit signal to view to set grid
      size.
      Spacing also affects the category which we 100% do not want, so
      we have to use
      the grid size. This has the effect the spacing on the left hand
      side is
      only 1/2 of the spacing between items, but that's ok (we can
      think about
      more evenly distributing width spacing in an optimized way, like
      dolphin).
      There is a workaround in place for spacing below the category.
      Category spacing should be independent from item spacing.

      libs/models/imagemodel.cpp, libs/models/imagemodel.h: - in
      ImageModel, change the id QSet to a QHash id->index in infos list
      - with that done, add methods to retrieve and index from a given
      id of image info
      - listen to ImageChange signals in ImageModel to emit dataChanged
      signals.
      The flags to watch need to be set explicitly.

      The built-in d'n'd support falls short in quite a few fields,
      it is not fine-grained enough for our needs, decides too much on
      its own
      and allows dropping in between items which we absolutely do not
      want.
      We can use most of it but override the important parts.

      A drag and drop handler will do stuff that is on view's terrain
      like
      displaying context menus, but it will access model's data and
      backend
      d'n'd is more models' area. So we have this class in between the
      two,
      a bit like a delegate.

      any idea how to align the icon to the left and the text to the
      right?

      Do you think this width detection is accurate?

      when
      the code is not commented.

      The old version was way too slow when used on a bigger image (8MP
      or
      more). It took 5 minutes on my dual core machine.
      I have split the drawing of the border into 4 parts:

      - upper right corner
      - lower left corner
      - right border
      - bottom border

2009-03-14 21:49  mwiesweg

    * A fully multithreaded sortfilterproxy model for filtering an
      ImageModel.
      Uses the hook in ImageModel to get hold of ImageInfos before they
      are published
      so they can be prepared and filtered in dedicated threads.
      Preparing means to cache those parts that do not come from the
      ioslave - currently
      tags and comments. Doing this in chunks for a list of entries has
      a potential to
      speed up db access, implementation is to do.
      Threading is done by threads running an event loop being fed with
      queued signals.
      Granularity of threaded chunks need to be fine tuned for real
      use.
      Some more difficult situations like changing filter while still
      listing
      need some testing and maybe profiling.
      (These models as such work, tested with a standard QListView)

2009-03-14 21:49  mwiesweg

    * A dedicated value class to hold filter settings as used

    * Model derived from ImageModel that uses our kioslave to display
      albums.
      Code is mostly identical to parts from AlbumLister.

2009-03-14 21:49  mwiesweg

    * Initial implementation of a model for ImageInfos.
      The underlying data structure is simply a QList, so it's pretty
      straightforward.
      There is a hook for a filter to preprocess image infos before the
      come available.
      Listing from database will be done by derived classes.
      Current data() is simple, thumbnail loading remains to be done,

    * Declare ImageInfo as a movable type. This makes using it in a
      QList more efficient:
      It's a shared datatype with the sizeof a pointer anyway, like
      QString.
      By telling this Qt can store the object directly in QList's
      pointer array
      instead of allocating a new ImageInfo() for every entry.

    * If you select multiple images in TAlbumFolderView, it sometimes
      happens
      that a gray rectangle is drawn about the highlighted item.
      This effect can be seen if you select multiple images with tags
      that are
      not assigned to every image in your selection.
      The checkbox of the ListItem is grayed out a little bit and since
      we
      don't reset the Brush, this color will be used when we draw the
      highlight rectangle.

      this is true on my

      nearly
      twice the size of the matrix db entry (which is 508 Bytes).

    * Add a new "Find Duplicates - Fast" search mode:

      "Fast-Mode" will only query the database for exact signatures and
      display the results, no difference calculation will be done.
      This mode is similar to the "fast checksum mode" from digiKam
      0.9.x
      series.
      This mode will only find exact matches (same image dimensions,
      same
      signature), but unlike the checksum method from 0.9.x it will
      also
      detect different file size images, as long as the signature is
      the same.

      A new dialog is shown in the "Find Duplicates" tab so the user
      can
      choose which mode he prefers to use.

    * Adapt ImagePreviewView to new API of ContextMenuHelper

2009-02-21 15:09  aclemens

    * API change: Menus are now registered with a ContextMenuHelper
      object.
      This way it is not as flexible as it was before, but it saves us
      from
      typing and we can handle special actions more easily.
      For this to work, ContextMenuHelper has its own exec() method
      that
      should be used instead of the one from a QMenu instance.
      The exec() method will return the triggered action as well as an
      actionId, if a special action was chosen (goto actions, find
      similar
      etc).
      Right now this is the easiest way to handle actions, but it would
      be
      much better if some of those predefined actions in
      ContextMenuHelper
      would be globally available.

    * to hopefully fix bug 173746, set the imagePreviewView to not
      collapsible, too. Using setChildrenCollapsible doesn't work for
      some
      reason, the thumbbar can still be resized to 0, but when setting
      both
      widgets manually to not collapsible, it is working.

2009-02-19 08:44  aclemens

    * somehow setChildrenCollapsible is not working correctly, the
      thumbbar is
      still dragable to a size of zero, which can lead to a
      disappearing
      thumbbar again when the splitter state is saved. The user will
      not know
      why the menu entry "Show Thumbnails" is not working anymore. To
      save us
      from more and more bugreports about this (:-)), we need to set
      only the thumbbar to be not
      collapsible. Works fine now.

2009-02-19 08:14  aclemens

    * if the thumbbar is turned off in ImagePreviewView and digiKam is
      restarted, the thumbbar is not restorable anymore. You need to
      find the
      splitter and drag it up (the infamous splitter bug, yeah).
      This commit fixes the issue and might also fix our general
      splitter bug,
      because now collapsing of children is turned off, so no "invalid"
      state
      could be saved.

      this I can see so far.

    * Disable fullscreen action from context menu right now, we can't
      get rid
      of the checkbox. I still think this action is very important and
      should
      be added somehow.
      Also change "View" action back to "Back to Album", to avoid the

    * The context menu of the ImagePreviewView now uses the new
      ContextMenuHelper. I have also changed the layout a little bit
      and
      removed the slideshow action (it makes more sense in
      AlbumIconView) and
      added the fullscreen action instead.

      Gilles, can you give me a feedback on this? What do you think?

    * Add ContextMenuHelper class.
      This class will help adding actions to a menu, to avoid duplicate
      code
      in all the context menus throughout digiKam and showFoto.
      Most of the context menus are already patched to use this class,
      but I
      will need to test some issues before committing this.
      Also I'm not sure about the API of ContextMenuHelper, some
      methods could
      be simplified due to the use of global actions. I guess there
      will be
      more changes in the future.

    * digiKam from 0.11 branch :

      - move action to show Batch Queue MAnaer to Tools main menu.
      - add new action to Image main menu to add current selection into
      current Queue from batch manager.
      - add new action to Image main menu to add current selection into
      a new Queue from batch manager.
      - Fix pop-up menu accordingly (icon view and preview mode)

      Andi, please review pop-up menus and fix usabililty if necessary.
      Factorize actions with Action Collection is welcome too.

      The original bug: Newly added collection may be listed as empty
      by the ioslave
      because it did not know the new collection yet if it had been
      running already.
      
      The problem: KIOSlaves do not have an event loop in their main
      thread and therefore
      cannot receive DBus signals (they can send them though)
      
      Howto make KIOSlaves receive DBus signals:
      Create a dedicated thread that creates it's own DBusConnection
      (not sessionBus()),
      connects the DBus signals (including to objects in other threads)
      and then enters
      its event loop.
      When queued signals are send to the KIOSlave's main thread, you
      need to call
      QEventLoop's processEvents for example when you start an
      operation.

      With current implementation, we are not able to have one common
      loadViewState() and saveViewState() method, so we need to
      re-implement
      them in TAlbumListView and TagFilterView. This is not nice
      because we
      have duplicate code now, but since we are going to switch to
      ModelView
      concept next release, it would be a waste of time to create a new
      common
      interface or abstract class now.
      
      We can not call virtual methods in constructors / destructors, so
      every
      view inherited from FolderView needs to call saveViewState() in
      its own
      destructor instead.

    * libs/database/schemaupdater.cpp: KIO jobs cannot be started from
      the non-UI thread.
      Now when updating the database from 0.9, we used a KIO job from a
      worker thread,
      and this worked well for this job. But in this case internal KIO
      objects
      (KIO::Scheduler) will be created in this worker thread, so all
      following usage of KIO
      from the main thread will fail, which caused the effect that no
      images are visible after
      the first start when updating.
      Fix with using QFile::copy methods in SchemaUpdater.
      
      (KIO should enforce not being used from worker thread in
      KIO::Scheduler construction;
      or, there do not seem to be too large obstacles for creating
      per-thread usage to remove
      the restriction)

    * libs/dimg/loaders/pngloader.cpp: Fix memory leak detected by

      something like
      uchar *data = 0; if (setjmp) { delete data; return; }; data = new
      uchar[]; longjmp;
      will never delete the allocated memory because data is again 0
      after setjmp.

      is not re-assigned and so we have a memory leak here. Setting the

      3) At least one of these conditions is not met: !(A && B && C),

      Gilles, Marcel,
      
      simple search is not focusing / switching to the "search tab" on
      the left automatically,
      so this action is not very useful if the "advanced search" tab is
      closed or not displayed at all. It only works if the tab is
      already
      opened.
      I think we need to focus the tab automatically, like when using

      digikam/albumiconview.h: With my test generateFuzzyPixmap()
      accounted for 55% of the CPU cost of icon view item drawing.
      We cannot simply cache one pixmap here because every thumbnail
      can have different width or height
      (either is the thumbnail size, the other depends on the aspect
      ratio).
      We can take care for the majority of use cases though where the
      aspect ratios are limited,
      you usually have an album of one camera only with
      landscape/portrait.
      Cache the last 10 used fuzzy pixmaps in a central place in
      AlbumIconView.

      for fuzzyRect generation.

2008-12-13 15:11  mwiesweg

    * libs/database/collectionmanager.cpp: Remove the trailing slash,
      if any, in these cases.
      
      CCBUG: 175322

2008-12-13 15:11  mwiesweg

    * utilities/cameragui/cameraui.cpp,
      utilities/cameragui/camerauiprivate.h: polish, readability

2008-12-13 15:11  mwiesweg

    * utilities/cameragui/cameraui.cpp: Do not mark as downloaded when
      the download failed.

2008-12-13 15:11  mwiesweg

    * utilities/cameragui/cameracontroller.cpp: Properly reorganize
      this code, something went wrong when porting from Qt3.
      Ensure a success or fail signal is always sent.

2008-12-13 15:10  mwiesweg

    * utilities/cameragui/cameraui.cpp: Allow the user to try to
      download anyway if not enough space is available
      (the default option remains to cancel)
      There may be cases (network storage) where our free space methods
      fail.

2008-12-13 15:10  mwiesweg

    * utilities/cameragui/freespacewidget.cpp,
      utilities/cameragui/freespacewidget.h: - add a method to retrieve
      the available space of a specific path
      - constify

2008-12-13 15:10  mwiesweg

    * utilities/cameragui/cameraui.cpp, utilities/cameragui/cameraui.h:
      Give all collection paths to the free space widget

2008-12-13 15:10  mwiesweg

    * digikam/main.cpp: Now that the AlbumSettings does not indirectly
      stored this, update here (more appropriate place anyway)

2008-12-13 15:10  mwiesweg

    * digikam/albumsettings.cpp, digikam/albumsettings.h: Get rid of
      the album library path, which is invalid anyway.

2008-12-13 15:10  mwiesweg

    * utilities/cameragui/freespacewidget.cpp,
      utilities/cameragui/freespacewidget.h: Make the free space widget
      ready to support multiple path, aggregating the size results.
      Needed now that we have multiple collection paths.

    * utilities/setup/setupcollections.cpp: digiKam from trunk : Under
      Win32, sound like signals/slots connection are initialized faster
      than under Linux. We need to take a care about that in the
      future.
      
      So what the problem exactly : In Setup dialog, KURLRequester
      slots are connected before than DB path is set by readSettings()
      method. We entry in a long loop where path is set, signals
      emitted, path is set, etc... A broken path is set in DB url
      editor at end.
      
      Solution: make signal and slots connections after that
      readSettings() is done.

    * utilities/setup/setupcollections.cpp,
      utilities/setup/setupcollections.h: Remove the old implementation
      and replace it with the new SetupCollectionView/Model.

2008-11-15 15:41  mwiesweg

    * utilities/setup/setupcollectionview.cpp,
      utilities/setup/setupcollectionview.h: A custom tree view, model
      and delegate for the collections setup.
      - The view is a QTreeView
      - The delegate inherits KWidgetItemDelegate / Goya framework to
      provide
      widgets inside the view. Rendering is done through an object of
      QStyledItemDelegate
      - The model is custom. It keeps a list of collections, allows
      editing and does
      all the work of checking and applying the changes to
      CollectionManager
      
      Collections are sorted in the three categories local, removable
      and network.
      An "Add collection" button is provided for all three. We can
      autodetect local and
      removable storage media, but we cannot autodetect that a path is
      a network share
      currently, so this solves the problem of providing an extra
      button for network collections.
      When adding a collection the path dialog pops up directly, then
      the path is checked,
      and in a second dialog the user can adjust the name of the
      collection and is informed
      about the status of the storage.
      This reintroduces modal dialogs that we did not need with the
      previous implementation,
      but 1) the directory dialog was needed usually anyway and 2) we
      can display much more
      and flexible information.
      
      Label editing is done in-place with standard delegate editor
      means.
      Deleting is done with a small icon button for each collection.

2008-11-15 15:40  mwiesweg

    * libs/database/collectionmanager.cpp,
      libs/database/collectionmanager.h: - Add basic functionality to
      support collection on network shares.
      There is no autodetection, you have to give the mount path and
      say it is a network share.
      The collection will be considered available if the directory is
      not empty.
      The identification in the database is done via mount path.
      As usual we are free to add other means of identification is they
      are available in the future.
      - Extend checkLocation (and add checkNetworkLocation) to always
      provide
      meaningful information and a good icon symbolising the kind of
      storage

      digikam/tagfolderview.cpp,
      libs/imageproperties/imagedescedittab.cpp: collapse children of
      matching album / tag names.
      
      If an album name matches the filter in one of the children of the
      current item, but not the current item's own name,
      don't expand the current item.
      This will prevent the following situation. Assume we have this
      album layout:
      
      |-- 1999
      | |-- Alleyras
      | `-- Test
      | |-- 01
      | `-- 02
      `-- 2008
      `-- all
      |-- 01
      `-- 02
      
      When we search for the term all, we will get this layout with the
      old behavior:
      
      |-- 1999
      | |-- Alleyras
      `-- 2008
      `-- all
      |-- 01
      `-- 02
      
      But this is wrong and can get quite messy if you have heavy
      nested folders. We should only display the folder names that
      really match the term.
      We can either do this by removing all folders that don't match
      the criteria, but this is bad. Assume we search for "birthday"
      and want to see the underlying folders.
      With this method they'll be gone. So the only other possible way
      is to collapse all non matching children like this:
      
      |-- 1999
      | |-- Alleyras
      `-- 2008
      `-- all
      
      You still can expand the folder 'all' to get the sub-folders, but
      they will not mess up the folder view anymore.
      Ok this was a long description for a commit... :-)

      digikam/tagfolderview.cpp,
      libs/imageproperties/imagedescedittab.cpp: expand and collapse
      folder view when using quick filter text search
      
      When searching for albums and tags with the quick filter text
      search, the
      folder view has not been expanded when an item matched the search
      criteria.
      
      For this to work, we have to use setOpen() on every matched item.
      In most of
      the cases the whole album or tag tree will be expanded after you
      reset the
      filter again, which will be very annoying when you have a lot of
      tags or albums.
      
      This commit will introduce a new FolderView method
      collapseView(),
      that will collapse the tree when the search criteria is removed.
      Right now it has two modes:
      
      * RestoreCurrentAlbum (default):
      Collapse the folder view and re-open the current viewed album.
      In this mode, all root items are collapsed, then the one
      containing
      the currently selected album is expand again.
      This mode will make sure that the selected album is visible in
      the folder tree by scrolling the
      view to the selected item.
      
      * OmitRoot:
      Collapse the folder view but omit the root item.
      In this mode all items in the folder view are collapsed,
      and the first root item is expanded again (My Tags / My Albums
      etc)

      with core implementation.
      CMake generate a script (bash under Linux or Bat under windows)
      to run digiKam using local built without
      to install something in your computer. It's very suitable to use
      this way to test speedly a new change.
      
      In old Cmake implementation, there is a conflict between
      libdigikam shared lib and digikam bin program to
      define set of target names. the script dedicated to run digikam
      (named digikam_bin) do not run because it try
      to play with digikam_bin binary file, which doesn't exist (only
      digikam file exist of course)
      
      This fix rename libdigikam to libdigikamcore to remove this
      dysfunction.
      
      NOTE: you need to clean up all and recompile. Let's me hear is
      all is fine for you.

      I think it is much easier to change text that has been rotated in
      an Inkscape project, because you can edit it directly. In a Gimp
      project it's not possible.
      Also the output is much more crisp, the font is not so washed
      out.
      I guess we should remove the Gimp project files...
      
      In addition we could merge both Inkscape project files and work
      with layers. Since we have same version numbers for digiKam and
      showFoto, we could put each app name on its own layer and just
      export the appropriate one when saving the new image.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2008-10-26 16:33  mwiesweg

	* digikam/albummanager.cpp: This was a bitwise XOR operator

2008-10-26 15:54  aclemens

	* imageplugins/coreplugin/iccprooftool.cpp,
	  libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.cpp, project/release/lib/libl10n.rb,
	  utilities/cameragui/cameraui.cpp,

	  utilities/cameragui/umscamera.cpp: fix <br> tag (should be <br/>)

2008-10-26 12:39  scripty

	* digikam/digikam.desktop, kioslave/digikamtags.protocol,
	  showfoto/showfoto.desktop,
	  utilities/hotplug/digikam-download.desktop.cmake,
	  utilities/hotplug/digikam-gphoto2-camera.desktop.cmake,
	  utilities/hotplug/digikam-mount-and-download.desktop.cmake,

2008-10-26 11:29  cgilles

	* project/bootstrap.bat: missing path to qt plugins

2008-10-26 03:06  sengels

	* CMakeLists.txt, digikam/CMakeLists.txt, showfoto/CMakeLists.txt:
	  restrict KDE4_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS to where it is needed with msvc
	  This means digikam builds now both under mingw and msvc

	  libs/database/imageposition_p.h, libs/database/imagescanner.cpp:
	  This a more severe change, but it should work nevertheless
	  everywhere: I needed to take out the Private classes out of the
	  .cpp files so that QSharedData will work correctly.
	  If you prefer another solution, I will check that one as well and
	  we can change this part

2008-10-26 01:39  sengels

	* imageplugins/coreplugin/sharpnesseditor/clapack/f2c.h,

2008-10-25 23:37  sengels

	  available

2008-10-25 22:32  sengels

	* libs/dimg/dimg.cpp: another extern error and missing header

2008-10-25 22:30  sengels

	* libs/dimg/loaders/tiffloader.cpp: move local header

2008-10-25 22:30  sengels

	* libs/dimg/loaders/rawloader.h: */ is interpreted as end of
	  comment mark

2008-10-25 22:28  sengels

	* libs/dimg/loaders/jp2kloader.h: another extern "C" fix

2008-10-25 22:27  sengels

	* libs/database/imagescanner.cpp: Fix several bugs in this code:
	  - supply full file path to QImageReader
	  - use KMimeType::findByPath, KMimetype::mimetype is of course
	  wrong here
	  - make Qt the first priority; mime type names are often not what
	  we want.
	  For PPM, Qt returns "ppm", which we want while the mimetype is
	  "x-portable-pixmap".
	  
	  Fixes format detection for 8bit PPMs

	* NEWS, digikam/albumwidgetstack.cpp,

	  since the timer calls slotUpdate() immediately, we can also
	  remove the timer completely and call the slot manually from
	  within triggerUpdate(), so no API change will be done.
	  This seems to fix the problem that sometimes a thumbnail in the
	  filmstrip isn't shown correctly.
	  Maybe we don't even need triggerUpdate() anymore, but if we want
	  to do additional processing in there, this is the best solution
	  right now that doesn't change any program logic.

	* digikam/albumwidgetstack.cpp, libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.cpp:
	  fix centering of the selected image in filmstrip
	  
	  this commit will fix the centering of the currently selected
	  image in album icon view as well as in image editor.
	  Strangely showFoto isn't working, although it is derived from the
	  same class as image editor.
	  
	  There is still a problem on first init: sometimes the width of
	  the content is unknown, so that a item in the thumbbar is
	  highlighted, but the bar is not scrolled to the
	  correct position. This is only true for the first image
	  displayed, all the other times it is working, since now the
	  thumbbar is not re-generated all the time.
	  
	  This patch also fixes the re-generating of the thumbbar every
	  time an image is selected and viewed from the album icon view.
	  On large albums the old behavior was very slow.
	  
	  Marcel, Gilles,
	  
	  we still have the thread problem I mentioned before and that
	  someone else posted here. Sometimes you get a very high CPU load
	  while thumbbar is created and digiKam will crash on close.
	  I have not figured out why this is sometimes happening.

	* digikam/scancontroller.cpp, libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp:
	  Revert "Add debug messages to get timing of collection scan."
	  (commit 869626)
	  because bug 172269 is resolved now.

2008-10-11 15:21  aclemens

	* NEWS: update

2008-10-11 15:05  aclemens

	* showfoto/showfoto.cpp, showfoto/showfoto.h: Use KJob* instead of
	  KIO::Job* for the signal 'result', otherwise an image will not be
	  deleted correctly and removed from the images list.

2008-10-11 15:05  aclemens

	* libs/widgets/common/histogramwidget.cpp,
	  utilities/cameragui/cameraiconview.cpp: Obsolete macros QMIN(),
	  Q_MIN(), QMAX() and Q_MAX() should be replaced by the qMin() and
	  qMax() functions.

2008-10-11 14:21  aclemens

	* utilities/searchwindow/searchfields.cpp: call valueChanged()
	  manually when clearbutton is pressed in advanced search dialog
	  for SearchFieldRangeDate widgets.
	  
	  Since no signal is emitted from KDateEdit when a date / time is
	  changed with setDate() / setTime(), we need to call
	  valueChanged() manually in the reset() method, otherwise the
	  clear button will not be hidden when fields are empty.

2008-10-11 13:55  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp: Do not use the file name
	  filter that comes with QDir.entryInfoList, which
	  is very slow for larger file counts and filtered suffixes.
	  Just get all files and use plain simple suffix filtering from a
	  QSet.
	  
	  Speeds up complete collection scan by approximately factor 20.

2008-10-11 13:04  cgilles

	* digikam/digikamfirstrun.cpp: compile with Qt < 4.4.x

2008-10-11 12:49  aclemens

	* utilities/fuzzysearch/findduplicatesview.cpp: change layout of
	  the findduplicatesview
	  
	  The new statusprogressbar widget becomes too small with an
	  activated cancel button.
	  The progressbar is now moved beneath the "find duplicates"
	  button.

2008-10-11 09:27  aclemens

	* libs/widgets/common/statusprogressbar.cpp,
	  utilities/fuzzysearch/findduplicatesview.cpp,
	  utilities/fuzzysearch/findduplicatesview.h: First implementation
	  of a cancel action for the find duplicates feature.
	  
	  Right now KJob::kill() is used to stop the search for duplicate
	  images.
	  Hopefully this is enough and plays well with the database
	  connection.

2008-10-11 09:27  aclemens

	* libs/widgets/common/statusprogressbar.cpp,
	  utilities/fuzzysearch/findduplicatesview.cpp: Set the
	  progressBarMode already in the constructor of the FindDuplicates
	  view, so that the progressBar widget is actually shown.
	  
	  The problem is that is will always show 0%, the old QProgressBar
	  widget was completely empty.
	  But this is not too important right now, it is just an aesthetic
	  property.

	* libs/widgets/common/sidebar.cpp: Default value of active tab

	  Fixes a bug I encountered after first run with empty config,
	  when selecting an album in left side bar would have no effect
	  (because sidebar had not emitted the signalChangedTab signal,
	  and the AlbumFolderView was not set setActive(true))

2008-10-09 13:47  mwiesweg

	* digikam/digikamfirstrun.cpp: FirstRun:
	  - change wording of messages so that first time users may have a
	  better understanding what they are supposed to do
	  - if provided, use desktop wide default value for pictures
	  directory.
	  KDE4.2 will have this from KGlobalSettings, Qt4.4's
	  QDesktopService
	  provides the same for KDE4.1. It uses the XDG spec. For me the
	  values
	  are empty; fallback is ~/Pictures as before.
	  - Remove check that does not allow ~ as database dir, I dont see
	  the reason

	  utilities/imageeditor/rawimport/rawsettingsbox.h: re-factorize
	  histogramwidget in all editor tools and sidebars
	  
	  Until now the histogram widget in the editor tools and the
	  sidebar has been implemented by copy & paste.
	  Changes to that code had to be made in all of the 13 editor tools
	  and the
	  sidebars that use a histogram.
	  Also the slots slotChannelChanged() and slotScaleChanged() where
	  implemented in every single
	  editor tool, although they use a common code base most of the
	  time (only channel mixer, adjustcurves
	  and adjustlevels use slightly different slots).
	  So it is time to factorize this code.
	  
	  This patch will move all histogram related code into a new
	  widget:
	  HistogramBox.
	  This widget holds a histogram widget as well as all the control
	  widgets for it,
	  like the scale buttons, the channel selector and the optional
	  gradient widget.
	  
	  To use the histogrambox in editor tools, a new toolcode is
	  introduced to enable
	  the histogram. To set its mode, a third parameter 'histogramType'
	  is added to
	  the ctor of EditorToolSettings. The different modes for the
	  HistogramBox are
	  defined in the enum HistogramType.
	  
	  HistogramBox defines the following methods:
	  
	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	  
	  histogram() :
	  returns the histogram widget
	  
	  setGradientVisible(bool) :
	  show / hide the color gradient widget beneath the histogram
	  widget.
	  Some tools like adjustcurves and adjustlevels don't need that
	  widget so we need a way to
	  disable it
	  
	  setGradientColors(const QColor &from, const QColor &to) :
	  set the color range for the gradient widget.
	  
	  channel() :
	  returns the selected channel (Luminosity, RGB etc). Since a
	  QVariant is used in the channel combobox,
	  we need to convert the ID of the combobox item to the actual
	  channel value. This method handles the
	  conversion.
	  
	  setChannel(int channel) :
	  set the current histogram channel. Due to the use of the QVariant
	  we need to convert the channel id properly.
	  This method handles the conversion.
	  
	  setColorsEnabled(bool) :
	  if 'Colors' channel can be used in the editor tool, we need to
	  provide a method to enable / disable this
	  combobox.
	  
	  setColors(int color) :
	  set the current ColorsChannel
	  
	  scale() :
	  get the current selected histogram scale (linear, logarithmic)
	  
	  setScale(int scale) :
	  set the current histogram scale
	  
	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

2008-09-17 11:26  mwiesweg

	* digikam/albummanager.cpp: - handle properly an AlbumChangeset for

	  scanPAlbums
	  
	  - adapt the changed renameAlbum call

2008-09-17 11:25  mwiesweg

	* kioslave/digikamalbums.cpp: Copy and rename should now be
	  gracefully handled by the CollectionScanner.
	  
	  Doing it from the kioslave was a valid solution for a long time,
	  but had its
	  shortcomings (the bug with the pseudo .digikam_properties file,
	  possible timing
	  problems with ScanController kicking in)

	* digikam/dio.cpp, digikam/dio.h, digikam/dio_p.h: Large cleanup:
	  
	  Remove all old code.
	  Give DIO a new and better defined purpose: Provide copy/move
	  methods taking
	  PAlbum* instead of a Url, and let DIO methods handle all details.
	  Issue the appropriate KIO action and record CopyMove hints with
	  ScanController.

2008-09-17 11:25  mwiesweg

	* digikam/scancontroller.cpp, digikam/scancontroller.h: Support for
	  collecting CopyMove hints and passing them on to
	  CollectionScanner.
	  
	  As ScanController is persistent and CollectionScanner objects
	  only
	  created when needed, hints are stored here.

2008-09-17 09:15  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp,
	  libs/database/collectionscanner.h: - add internal structures to
	  look up hints as to copy/move of albums and items
	  - delete orphan (database stale) albums typically at application
	  startup scan
	  - consolidate scanning routines to scanNewFile() and
	  scanModifiedFile()
	  - use AlbumCopyMoveHints to identify albums deleted on the file
	  system
	  as actually renamed to another place (and due to be found on next
	  scanning),
	  and just rename in the database
	  - use AlbumCopyMoveHints to identify the source of a newly found
	  (copied) album,
	  and copy over album properties
	  - use both ItemCopyMoveHints and AlbumCopyMoveHints to find the
	  possible source
	  of a newly found file, and copy over attributes if applicable.

2008-09-17 09:14  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/imagescanner.cpp, libs/database/imagescanner.h: Add
	  a method similar to newFile, but which takes the id of an image
	  which is to be regarded copy source of the new file, and
	  attributes
	  will be copied from the entry.

2008-09-17 09:13  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/databasechangesets.h,

2008-09-17 09:12  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/albumdb.cpp, libs/database/albumdb.h: - introduce
	  deferred deletion to albums as it is already done for images - do
	  not immediately remove
	  the entry from the database, but make it orphan by removing the
	  AlbumRoot id.
	  - allow changing of albumRootId in renameAlbum

2008-09-17 09:09  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/collectionscannerhints.cpp,
	  libs/database/collectionscannerhints.h: Container classes to
	  contain descriptions of move or copy operations on albums or
	  images.
	  Source and destination is stored, so that the originating image
	  can be deduced
	  when the newly created destination is scanned.

	* libs/dimg/loaders/rawloader.cpp, libs/dimg/loaders/rawloader.h:
	  digiKam from trunk : with libkdcraw from trunk based on libraw,
	  we don't use KProcess anymore.
	  RAWloader::checkToCancelReceivingData() is now a depreciate
	  method, and is not used by libkdcraw.
	  
	  Marcel, it still a problem to cancel libkdcraw loading/saving
	  job.
	  Look KDcrawPriv::progressCallback(). This method is called by
	  libraw to report progress information (for the moment on the
	  console)
	  I use this method to call RAWLoader::checkToCancelWaitingData().
	  By debugger it called fine, but observer never return true when
	  user
	  cancel operation (for ex, when raw image is loaded, and editor is
	  closed before end of loading)
	  
	  What's wrong exactly ?

      ImageHaarMatrix table
      (really difficult to remember all places to update after addition

      Updating the trigger is completely forward- and backward
      compatible, so
      I think there is no problem to bring it in now.

      operations
      - mark moving/renaming as TODO (need to find really clean sync
      with CollectionScanner)
      - do not list the digikam_properties file automatically anymore.
      This is needed only for copying of albums, which we dont support
      anyway right now.
      If, then DIO on the main app side should add this pseudo-file to
      be copied.

      The problem is that moc needs to have the full qualification
      including namespace
      when sending custom types over DBus, as qDBusRegisterMetaType
      will use
      the qualification set by Q_DECLARE_METATYPE, which macros in turn
      needs to
      be outside any namespace, therefore requiring full qualification
      for its argument,
      which is converted to literal.

      BUG: 167867

2008-08-24 05:16  mwiesweg

    * digikam/albummanager.cpp, digikam/albummanager.h: - add a method
      to check if a given database path differs from current settings
      
      - return from setDatabase if path does not differ
      - add a method prepareItemCounts() that performs a subset of
      refresh()
      and guarantees valid item counts for tree views
      - stop timers in the methods called by these timers, to avoid
      double
      execution of called directly before timer expires
      
      Note: If anyone feels that the timer intervals (see constructor)
      are
      too conservative for today's machines, feel free to fine-tune

    * digikam/albummanager.cpp, digikam/albummanager.h: Listen to
      database signals for all album and album item count changes:
      
      - watch Album-, Tag-, SearchChangesets for addition and removal
      of these albums
      - watch CollectionImageChangesets for album item count and DAlbum
      management
      - watch ImageTagChangesets for tag item count
      
      - use timers to control the frequency of rescanning database
      operations.
      Tune timer timeout to the assumed cost of an operation
      - we could limit the rescan using the information about what has
      actually changed
      (e.g.: Recount only the one tag that was recently assigned) but
      this is
      a lot of coding work and it works just well as it is now
      - if AlbumManager itself is changing the db, holding
      DatabaseAccess,
      set a flag so that the resulting changesets are ignored
      
      todo: updating information for album icon change, search query
      change etc.

      crashes due to the preview widgets assigned to the KDialog
      objects (that are received by some KUrlReuqester widgets). It
      seems that the KUrlRequester gets deleted before the KDialog
      objects and so the pointer is not defined anymore.
      I have commented the lines that cause the crash, maybe we find a
      better solution for this (maybe global pointers in the class
      body?).

	* NEWS: update

2008-07-25 09:04  aclemens

	* libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.cpp, libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.h:
	  Images get removed twice from the thumbbar view when removing
	  them via keyboard shortcut or context menu. This happened due to
	  the use of the ThumbBarView::removeItem() method in the
	  appropriate slot as well as in the destructor of a ThumbBarItem.
	  To obtain backward compatibility we move the context of
	  removeItem() into a new method takeItem() and call this new
	  method from within the destructor of a ThumbBarItem, removeItem
	  only calls delete now.
	  This way we can remove an item "the old way" but also by calling
	  just delete.
	  Somehow the KDE3 branch is not affected by this because the
	  destructor is never called at all (I don't know why).

2008-07-12 20:38  mwiesweg

	* libs/widgets/common/sidebar.cpp, libs/widgets/common/sidebar.h:
	  Expensive solution for a small annoying and serious bug:
	  When the sidebar was hidden, then digikam closed, after
	  restarting
	  clicking on a tab bar button would show the sidebar at size 0
	  (only handle visible), which is a difficult to understand
	  situation.
	  
	  Solution:
	  Use a dedicated QSplitter subclass the cooperates closely with
	  the Sidebars it contains.
	  
	  Solves the bug. When the user now moves the splitter handle so
	  that
	  the sidebar collapses, this is recognized and the transformed as
	  if the sidebar was hidden by clicking on a button.
	  After expanding the sidebar, no size of 0 (only handle visible)
	  will be tolerated, in case of doubt the minimum size hint is
	  used.
	  
	  The SidebarSplitter class contains also the code to save and
	  restore
	  state directly from a KConfig group, removing a lot of duplicate
	  fiveliners in various classes.

	* utilities/batch/fingerprintsgenerator.cpp: Use the
	  getDirtyOrMissingFingerprintURLs for the faster method of
	  rebuilding all fingerprints.
	  This methods gets missing fingerprints, but as well all images
	  that were touched
	  (by modification data and file contents hash). This means you can
	  edit your pictures,
	  and this option will rebuild only the edited pictures.

2008-07-07 21:11  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/albumdb.cpp, libs/database/albumdb.h: Add a method
	  to retrieve item URLs for dirty fingerprint images.
	  Fix all other methods returning URLs so that they dont return
	  double slashes for album root albums (not fatal in paths, but not
	  perfect enough for my taste)

2008-07-07 20:23  mwiesweg

	* utilities/searchwindow/searchfields.cpp,
	  utilities/searchwindow/searchfields.h: For use with the
	  exposuretime field, add an option to SearchFieldRangeInt
	  to store the reciprocal value in XML (as double, with inverted
	  operators)
	  This is necessary for exposure time: People enter 1/50, the spin
	  box reads 50,
	  but we really need 1/50. TODO for the future: Make a spin box
	  that goes beyond
	  1/1 and that follows the convention (15, 30, 50, 60, 90, 125...)

2008-07-07 17:59  mwiesweg

	* utilities/searchwindow/searchfields.cpp: SearchFieldAlbum:
	  Support writing a list of album ids in one field instead of
	  one field for each album id.
	  Fields were grouped by the group-wide field operator, specified
	  by the user, usually AND. This does not work for albums and tags,
	  the user selects images in either album, not in both.

2008-07-07 17:58  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/imagequerybuilder.cpp: - support lists of ids for

2008-07-07 17:58  mwiesweg

	* utilities/searchwindow/searchfields.cpp: Add the necessary code
	  to use a wildcard in the format search field. This finally

	  - fix write() for Int and Double, see comment.

	  We cannot use a recursive mutex, we need to wait on it with a
	  cond var,
	  and that doesnt work with recursive mutexes.
	  To avoid the deadlock from 799499, make the updateDirWatch signal
	  queued.

2008-07-05 21:16  mwiesweg

	* utilities/searchwindow/searchview.cpp: - use deleteLater for
	  deleting a group. There is a warning on the console that you
	  shall not delete a widget from within its event handler (deleting
	  the Remove Group label)
	  
	  - make the Remove Group label underlined and italic, to
	  distinguish it as clickable

	  QPainter::begin

2008-07-05 20:19  mwiesweg

	* libs/widgets/iccprofiles/cietonguewidget.cpp: All the "Widget
	  painting can only begin as a result of a paintEvent" warnings
	  came from here.
	  Dont attempt to draw the pixmap on the widget outside
	  paintEvent().
	  Make painting more relaxed; for the simple cases (disabled,
	  loading), draw directly. Only cache
	  the tongue itself on a separate pixmap. Update pixmap only on
	  request.

2008-07-05 19:48  mwiesweg

	* utilities/searchwindow/searchfields.cpp,
	  utilities/searchwindow/searchfields.h: Show the Clear indicator

	* digikam/imagepreviewbar.cpp, libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.cpp,
	  libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.h,
	  utilities/lighttable/lighttablebar.cpp: Preloading in thumbbar,
	  second revision:
	  The conditions for triggering a preload are adjusted as follows:
	  Scrolling or rearranging sets a flag that a preload is needed.
	  Only after drawing (which requests to load the thumbnails) the
	  preloading
	  is then scheduled.
	  For me the result are now quite good. With slow to medium-fast
	  scrolling,
	  all thumbnails appear immediately.

2008-07-05 19:48  mwiesweg

	* libs/threadimageio/thumbnailloadthread.cpp,
	  libs/threadimageio/thumbnailloadthread.h: Add support for
	  preloading thumbnails

2008-07-05 19:48  mwiesweg

	* libs/threadimageio/managedloadsavethread.cpp,
	  libs/threadimageio/managedloadsavethread.h: Tweak thumbnail
	  loading:
	  - prepend a new thumbnail to the list, instead of appending. This
	  can lead to much
	  faster display when medium-fast scrolling in icon view.
	  A side effect is that thumbnail are sometimes visibly loaded
	  bottom up.
	  To circumvent this, the view would need to call
	  prependThumbnailGroup().
	  - add a method to preload thumbnails
	  
	  - fix a bug in the LoadingPolicyPrepend implementation for normal
	  loading tasks

2008-07-05 19:48  mwiesweg

	* libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.cpp, libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.h:
	  Preload the next few thumbnails that will become visible in
	  either direction.

2008-07-05 14:32  mwiesweg

	* libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.cpp: Add special handling for the
	  case the the requested tile size is larger
	  
	  than the allowed maximum thumbnail size.
	  In this case, we scale up the image, which results in bad-quality
	  blurred
	  versions pretending to be larger than the contained information
	  allows.
	  
	  I think we should set the thumbbar's maximum size so that the
	  user
	  cannot drag it larger than for the 256 thumbnails.

2008-07-05 14:32  mwiesweg

	* libs/threadimageio/thumbnailloadthread.cpp,
	  libs/threadimageio/thumbnailloadthread.h: Retrieve the maximum
	  size that a thumbnail can have

2008-07-05 14:32  mwiesweg

	* digikam/imagepreviewbar.cpp,
	  utilities/lighttable/lighttablebar.cpp: Use new method from
	  parent class

2008-07-05 14:31  mwiesweg

	* libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.cpp, libs/widgets/common/thumbbar.h:
	  By caching all thumbnails for all items in a thumbbar we create a
	  number of problems,
	  
	  especially if the album (all of whose items are in the thumbbar)
	  has more than 100 images:
	  - the global cache policy is circumvented
	  - implicitly cached objects, if another instance is kept, will
	  not be removed
	  from the QCache. This can lead to a situation where the thumbbar
	  items
	  block the whole cache, and new items cannot be stored. The
	  iconview
	  depends on at least all visible items available from the cache
	  - smooth scaling at painting is slow, caching a pixmap of the
	  right size
	  is much faster for drawing
	  - with even larger albums, think of a search album, memory usage
	  can be huge
	  
	  This commit brings the thumbbar to the same behavior used by icon
	  view,
	  taking pixmaps from the cache or triggering to load them.
	  We can implement more preloading (the next x items etc.) if we
	  need it.

2008-07-05 14:31  mwiesweg

	* digikam/albumiconitem.cpp, digikam/albumiconview.cpp: Use
	  defaultIconViewThread for IconView

2008-07-05 14:31  mwiesweg

	* libs/threadimageio/thumbnailloadthread.cpp,
	  libs/threadimageio/thumbnailloadthread.h: Introduce two more
	  default thread objects. We use default threads everywhere,
	  
	  it's better to have separate threads e.g. in the icon view and in
	  the thumbbar,
	  but it's ok to share threads between all thumbbars.
	  
	  Add versions of the find methods that override the default
	  thumbnail size.
	  Using a global size per thread looks better API-wise but does not
	  carry
	  well with the way we share the threads. Need to look at some
	  places still
	  if they properly set the size.

	* libs/database/collectionmanager.cpp,
	  libs/database/databaseaccess.cpp, libs/database/databaseaccess.h:
	  Avoid deadlock:
	  
	  Do not hold a mutex when emitting a blocking queued signal.
	  In this case, ensure that DatabaseAccess is released, at least
	  temporarily.
	  Otherwise there will be a deadlock when emitting the synchronous
	  signal to
	  retrieve Solid information, and the main thread is currently
	  handling a signal
	  that wants to acquire DatabaseAccess.
	  Adds a class that unlocks the recursive mutex on creation, and
	  reqacuires on destruction.
	  This should be used with care as it undermines assumptions that
	  structures
	  cannot change while the lock is held. But you should not hold a
	  mutex when calling
	  methods with side effect (we do this here in at least one
	  situtation), so
	  I happily break assumptions (and there are no such assumptions
	  currently).

	  attributes,
	  inspired by SVG. This makes the resulting XML a bit more compact.

	* libs/database/haar/haariface.cpp: Do not use writeRawBytes, but
	  QDataStream's methods to serialize the integer data
	  of the Haar signature. Only this ensures that the signature can
	  be used cross-platform!
	  (think about accessing the database over a network from a little
	  and a big endian machine)
	  
	  Set the QDataStream binary version explicitly
	  (following tip from
	  http://www.purinchu.net/wp/2008/06/03/programming-tips/)
	  
	  Note: This changes the binary format of the Haar matrix; you need
	  to rebuild the fingerprints.
	  It seems there is a crash if you dont rebuild, so you will notice

	* libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp: Only use a global
	  DatabaseTransaction spanning the whole operation
	  in completeScan(). partialScan will typically run in the
	  background
	  and would make all other operations in the foreground fail if it
	  holds
	  the transaction lock.
	  This fixes the fingerprints batch generator.

2008-06-07 12:24  mwiesweg

	* utilities/searchwindow/searchfields.cpp: With the inclusion of
	  one extra hierarchy of root albums, it is
	  necessary to expand the first line of albums, so that the combo
	  box is not too small.
	  (the size of the combo box popup is determined by Qt in
	  showPopup, and adjusted to the number
	  of expanded items. With only to non-expanded item e.g., it would
	  be very small)

	* digikam/album.cpp, digikam/albummanager.cpp: Prepare AlbumManager

2008-06-07 12:24  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp: Scan for images in the root
	  directory of an album root as well.
	  
	  Historically, digikam had one album root and all subdirectories
	  of this root
	  were used as albums. Images in the root directory itself were not
	  included in
	  the collection (after all, there was no album for them).
	  Now that we can have multiple album roots, and the album roots
	  are represented
	  with an album in the album view, this exclusion is no longer
	  necessary.
	  This is important in particular for users who want to add one
	  single directory
	  containing images, but no subdirs, as an extra album root.
	  Previously this would
	  have resulted in one empty album, now it's still one album, but
	  it's filled.

	  - The reference image id
	  - The list of duplicate candidates.
	  
	  When Search KIOSlave will return the map, we will scan all
	  Duplicates Search albums using AlbumManager and list all in the
	  listview from left sidebar tab.
	  When user select an album, icon view will display all duplicate
	  candidates.
	  
	  What do you think about ?

	* libs/database/haar/haariface.cpp: Interface Haar calculation with
	  database.
	  
	  1) Indexing:
	  Methods accept filename, imageid, with preloaded QImage or DImg.
	  The obtained Haar::SignatureData is serialized into a QByteArray
	  (class DatabaseBlob does that with the help of QDataStream)
	  and written into the ImageHaarMatrix table.
	  Modification data and unique hash from the Images table
	  (identifying the current file) are copied to the table.
	  
	  2) Searching:
	  The original paper suggests a data structure where (for each
	  color channel,
	  for positive and negative) for each pixel a list contains those
	  imageids
	  that have a significant coefficient at that place. Such a
	  structure
	  requires pre-reading and approx. 5MB/10,000 images.
	  The current approach here does it the other way round.
	  It reads each sigle signature from the database, goes through its
	  list
	  of pixels with significant coefficient, and looks if the query
	  signature
	  has significant coefs as well at that pixel.
	  A simple benchmark searches 750*133 images (->100,000) in three
	  seconds
	  on my (relatively slow) machine.
	  Of course, I may have introduced bugs, which will show up once we
	  have a GUI for creating searches. (searching for identical images
	  works)

	* libs/database/imagequerybuilder.cpp,
	  libs/database/imagequerybuilder.h: Add support for searching the
	  database by GPS position.
	  You can specify a position by coordinates, and find all images
	  located around that position within a specified distance.
	  
	  The search is based on two parts.
	  Part 1: We compute a (false) "spherical rectangle" where the left
	  and right side
	  are longitude (thus Great circles), and the top and bottom are
	  latitudes
	  (no Great circles). This allows, by simple and fast comparison,
	  to sort
	  out the candidates of our search.
	  Part 2: We use the Haversine formula to compute the exact
	  distance.
	  This formula assumes the earth is a Sphere, and it's only the
	  second best,
	  but much faster assumption for such a computation.
	  
	  Part 1 is done in SQL, Part 2 by a post hook on the returned
	  result set in C++.
	  The ImageQueryBuilder can now return a list of post hooks and
	  ImageLister
	  checks the hooks for each result.
	  
	  Writing a position search can look like this:
	  
	  writer.writeField("position", SearchXml::Near);
	  writer.writeAttribute("type", "radius");
	  writer.writeAttribute("distance", QString::number(100));
	  writer.writeValue(QList<double>() << -23.029 << 65.9786725);
	  writer.finishField();
	  
	  Which search all images 100m around a certain point in
	  Northwestern Iceland.

	* libs/dmetadata/geodetictools.cpp, libs/dmetadata/geodetictools.h:
	  Add geodetic tools:
	  
	  GeodeticCalculator allows to
	  - compute the distance between two points on earth
	  - compute the second point, given a starting point, a distance
	  and an azimuth
	  
	  The algorithm is assuming the earth in an ellipsoid, and this is
	  the best
	  assumption available to make such computations.
	  
	  This code is taken from the geotools project, LGPL 2.1, now
	  relicensed
	  to GPL 2 or later (If equivalent code is provided by Marble,
	  we can use that one. I did not find any.)

	* digikam/searchtabheader.cpp: Usability polish:
	  - if the user has used the Advanced Search window, but has
	  effectively only used the
	  keywords field, recognize the search (by checking the XML) as a
	  keyword search and
	  treat it as such. Only if the advanced search options have
	  actually been used,
	  mark it as AdvancedSearch
	  - if an advanced search is the current search, display this text
	  in the line edit
	  for entering a keyword search. The user can still click the line
	  edit, in which
	  case the text disappears, and create a new keyword search, but he
	  is warned
	  to better use the advanced search button.

	  (with minor additions - see qcombobox_p.h in Qt source, but it
	  must be safe to use any view),
	  but for StayPoppedUpComboBox we need a public viewportEvent()
	  which requires subclassing

	  aberrations corrections will be corrected by this plugin.
	  - Still few camera model not supported properlly by LensFun.
	  There is no message to gui to ping user about.
	  - Sometime, LensFun device is null when a camera model is
	  selected. Why?
	  - We need to improve gui to have a manual correction: for ex,
	  lens focal must be selectable somewhere, and certainly more
	  settings as
	  Apeture. We need to discut about.
	  - I think than a visual preview of distorsion using a grid is a

	  - add a slotSelectSearch which is triggered from SearchTabHeader
	  in appropriate situations
	  - add a signal selectedSearchChanged to which the SearchTabHeader
	  listens and adjusts its UI
	  - add a static method that returns the fixed internal name of the
	  "Current Search" (similarly done in timeline)
	  - handle "Current Search" in UI appropriately
	  - remove context menu actions to add a new search and edit a
	  current one (now done from SearchTabHeader)

	* digikam/searchtabheader.cpp, digikam/searchtabheader.h: New
	  Search Interface:
	  
	  SearchTabHeader is the widget at the top of the search sidebar.
	  It provides a directly accessible line edit to start a quick
	  search, and a button
	  to start an advanced search.
	  In the lower part, the current search can be saved as a stored
	  search,
	  or if a stored search is selected, its parameters can be edited.
	  
	  Note:
	  The widget currently consists of two group boxes. This may not be
	  the best solution, but after some experiments with separator
	  line, flat group
	  boxes, QFrames etc. this was the most acceptable solution so far.
	  Note:
	  Advanced search is still under development; you will see that it
	  will
	  show an UI, but not carry out a search.

	* kioslave/digikamsearch.cpp, libs/database/imagelister.cpp,

	  ioslave to the ImageLister class;
	  
	  this is more coherent, no chunks of SQL passed around anymore.
	  ImageLister now takes a QString of search XML as argument.

	* digikam/albummodel.cpp, digikam/albummodel.h: AbstractAlbumModel
	  is a QAbstractItemModel based on our Albums as managed by
	  AlbumManager.
	  
	  This base class provides most of the functionality for mapping
	  albums
	  to QModelIndexes and vice versa and complete mapping of the
	  signals from AlbumManager
	  when an album is added, deleted or renamed. Editing and
	  Drag-and-Drop is not implemented.
	  
	  AbstractSpecificAlbumModel is a subclass that manages thumbnail
	  generation
	  for album and tag thumbnails.
	  
	  AbstractCheckableAlbumModel adds a property to make the albums in
	  the model
	  checkable. The check states are kept in an internal QHash.
	  Various methods
	  are provided to access the check state by Album*.
	  
	  AlbumModel and TagModel are finally the subclasses that can
	  readily be used,
	  providing physical albums and tags resp.

	  - SearchClickLabel / SearchSqueezedClickLabel provide a web-link
	  like interface
	  (more straightforward than KUrlLabel)
	  - ArrowClickLabel will provide a sort indicator that a certain
	  region can be extended
	  - TreeViewComboBox provides a QComboBox that has a QTreeView as
	  widget and
	  stays open if the user selects multiple entries from its view.

	  and adds them to a SearchFieldGroup.
	  Various subclasses of SearchField provide the actual widgets.

	* utilities/searchwindow/searchfieldgroup.cpp,
	  utilities/searchwindow/searchfieldgroup.h: A SearchFieldGroup is

	* digikam/albummanager.cpp, digikam/albummanager.h: For adding and

	  been deleted.
	  This fits better to the way Qt Models expect.

2008-01-05 22:22  mwiesweg

	* digikam/albumfiletip.cpp: Base the album file tip exclusively on
	  information from the database.
	  
	  This is good because we have all necessary information in
	  the database of course, and reading a DMetadata can take long (10
	  ms or 200 ms)
	  and tooltips should appear fast, and this allows to test database
	  information
	  for the first time.
	  
	  (BTW, colors of tooltips have changed wrt KDE3. By purpose?)

	  methods to read to structures from the database, similar to the
	  PhotoInfoContainer
	  
	  for DMetadata.
	  
	  The information is read by ImageScanner, this is because this
	  class knows the dirty details
	  of how to read information into the db, so it is the best place
	  to know how to interpret them.
	  The API to retrieve the containers of course is added to
	  ImageInfo

	* libs/dimg/loaders/jpegloader.cpp: Calling jpeg_start_decompress

	  header was to be read.
	  Rearrange so that header information can be safely read without
	  loading.
	  
	  The result of this bug was that only null values were read into
	  the db for width, height,
	  color model.

	* libs/database/collectionmanager.cpp,
	  libs/database/collectionmanager.h: To uniquely identify the
	  storage media of an album root,
	  
	  the UUID is a very good identifier, but it is not always
	  available.
	  There need to be other means of identification for the storage of
	  an album root.
	  Change the format of the album root identifier to a KUrl based
	  string
	  which allows easy storage of a variety of identifiers:
	  - UUID
	  - label
	  - hash of the file names in the top level directory (CD/DVD)
	  - mount path
	  - path
	  
	  Add private methods to create such identifiers, match Solid
	  volumes to a given identifier,
	  and find a volume for a given path. Adapt the code to the new
	  situation.
	  
	  Add a method to return an user-visible information string on how
	  a given path can be detected.
	  This can inform the user e.g. that a CD is identified by its
	  label, or a removable
	  USB disk can be uniquely identified by its UUID.
	  
	  This commit invalidates existing album roots; Either delete and
	  readd them,
	  or edit the AlbumRoots table field "identifier" by prepending
	  "volumeid:?uuid=".

	* digikam/kipiinterface.cpp, digikam/kipiinterface.h: digiKam from
	  trunk (KDE4): following Marcel tips by IRC, We use now a
	  dedicaced Multithreaded Thumbnail Loader
	  instance from digiKam core for all kipi-plugins we need thumb. We
	  never use default KDE thumbnails loader with
	  all kipi-plugins running under digiKam.
	  Why ? : because KDE thumnails loader is slow, do not work
	  properlly with JPEG and PNG, do not support RAW pictures,
	  do not rotate properlly thumbs accordinly to Exif or Xmp
	  metadata, etc...
	  
	  It's perfect... To test it, start SendImages kipi-plugin for ex.
	  and add new pictures to e-mail on the list.
	  Look how is render the pictures thumb on the left of open file
	  dialog (Standard KDE + new preview widget).
	  This rock! digiKam and kipi-plugins because more homogenous now.

	  With new database interface implemented by Marcel, digiKam can
	  use more than one root album path as collection of images.
	  digiKam database file is now stored in a customized place wich
	  still in local and can be different than roots album.
	  This is want mean than read only, remote repository, and
	  disconnected repository are fully suported as well.
	  
	  These collection types are able to use:
	  
	  - Local drive.
	  - Remote drive (NFS/Samba) previously mounted in local file
	  system.
	  - Removable drive as CD/DVD/USB hard drive.
	  
	  Each collection set in configuaration dialog page can be named to
	  be identified easily into Album GUI/Folder view.
	  
	  There is a fresh screenshot of Collection Setup page at this url:
	  
	  http://digikam3rdparty.free.fr/Screenshots/digikamKDE4_14.png

	  digiKam from trunk (KDE4) : First very important improvement here
	  depending of the new Database interface/schema dedicaced to
	  0.10.0 release.
	  
	  A new setting in album configuration page have been added to host
	  the database file used by digiKam in a dedicaced place.
	  Before, the SQlite3 database file (digikam3.db) used by digiKam
	  to store all image information like Tags, Rating, Comments,
	  Date, etc...
	  been store in the root album path. This solution introduce a big
	  problem to use a root album on a network file system like NFS,
	  because
	  SQLite3 do not like it (look here for more information :
	  http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q7)
	  
	  The only issue for this problem is to store the databse file in a
	  separate place...
	  
	  This is want mean than with this commit, digiKam can use a remote
	  root album...
	  
	  There is a screenshot of the new Album config page :
	  
	  http://digikam3rdparty.free.fr/Screenshots/digikamKDE4_13.png
	  
	  The next pending important change to do will to be able to drive
	  more than one root album path with digiKam 0.10.0...

	  Actually, this is a rare error condition.
	  But:
	  We must adjust the first-run wizard as well, it needs to do
	  something similar!
	  First getting a place for the db and the album roots, then

	  The new class takes care of scanning, the initial database setup,

	  This brings:
	  - progress info for the schema updating
	  - scanning is moved from the kioslave into the main process,
	  which allows much better control
	  (and some signals from the CollectionScanner in the future)
	  - all separated in its own thread, while the initial methods
	  wait in an event loop for the process to finish.
	  I prefer this to processEvents().

2007-10-17 19:08  mwiesweg

	* libs/dimg/dimg.cpp, libs/dimg/loaders/pngloader.cpp,
	  libs/dimg/loaders/rawloader.cpp: - correct setting of the
	  originalFilePath property in load()
	  
	  - optimize fileFormat: call KDcraw::rawFileIdentify (which is
	  expensive enough, creates a process) only when the output is
	  needed
	  - PNGLoader:
	  - libpng has some problems when png_read_end is called
	  and no reading has been done. Fix this.
	  - split the switch statement into two, only one of which is used
	  when no loading is done (and fixes colorspace property storing
	  for 16 bit)
	  - RAWLoader:
	  - KDcraw::decodeRAWImage inevitably causes a full load process
	  with DCRaw.
	  When LoadImageData is not set, only use rawFileIdentify

2007-10-17 19:08  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp,
	  libs/database/databasebackend.cpp, libs/database/imagelister.cpp,

	  - ImageLister: remove one surplus SELECT field
	  - ImageScanner: Consolidate checking for one valid field in list
	  - SchemaUpdater:
	  - add modificationDate and uniqueHash to ImageHaar table to store
	  the
	  file state and time at the time of creation of the Haar matrix
	  - imageid shall not be UNIQUE in ImageComments
	  - add one statement to remove orphan images leftover from old DB
	  while updating

2007-10-17 19:08  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/albumdb.cpp: - take care that all QDateTime are
	  properly converted from QString and avoid error message if date
	  string is null
	  
	  - move conversion clause to the correct method
	  - restore correct bound argument order in addImageMetadata
	  - fix SQL in getImageComments, changeImageComment,
	  imageMetadataFieldList, getAllCreationDates

2007-10-17 19:08  mwiesweg

	* digikam/albummanager.cpp, libs/database/albumdb.cpp,
	  libs/database/collectionmanager.cpp,
	  libs/database/databaseaccess.cpp, libs/database/imagescanner.cpp,
	  libs/database/schemaupdater.cpp: Fix various bugs

2007-10-17 19:08  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/databasebackend.cpp,
	  libs/database/databasebackend.h: - add support for "recursive"
	  behavior of DatabaseTransaction, i.e. for every begin there must
	  be a commitTransaction, and only for the last one the transaction
	  is actually committed. This allows for safe usage, as nesting is
	  not always avoidable
	  
	  - fix a bug in initSchema, return false on failure
	  - add debugging facility: Wrap exec in an extra method, with
	  debugging output
	  in case of failure
	  - fix a nasty bug in header file, one missing default parameter
	  made actually
	  the method with one QVariant parameter called instead of the
	  QvariantList one

2007-10-17 19:08  mwiesweg

	* digikam/albummanager.cpp, kioslave/digikamsearch.cpp: make
	  compile

2007-10-17 19:07  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/albumdb.cpp, libs/database/albumdb.h,
	  libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp, libs/database/imageinfo.cpp:
	  At the time it was a nice idea to write the absolute path and the
	  status
	  
	  of album roots dynamically into the database so that they were
	  available
	  from SQL.
	  But now I see that this is not the way to go. It does not allow
	  sharing DBs
	  (not that we support that officially, or say that it works, but
	  people will do
	  it once we support MySQL, and this would break it), and it does
	  not work
	  with read-only DBs.
	  So now, we always have the album root id and use
	  CollectionManager then
	  which has all the necessary information.
	  Adapt a lot of SQL.

2007-10-17 19:07  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/imagescanner.cpp, libs/database/imagescanner.h: -
	  rename the rescan method to fullScan()
	  
	  - make sure that Images table is updated in fullScan()
	  - Reorder methods to share code

2007-10-17 19:07  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/databaseaccess.cpp, libs/database/databaseaccess.h,
	  libs/database/databaseparameters.cpp,
	  libs/database/imagelister.cpp, libs/database/imagelister.h: -
	  Initialize CollectionManager in DatabaseAccess
	  
	  - remove DatabaseAccess::albumRoot which was temporary and now
	  deprecated
	  - change database file now to digikam4.db
	  - Adapt SQL in ImageLister, which still used
	  DatabaseAccess::albumRoot,
	  and now takes everything from the db

2007-10-17 19:07  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/albuminfo.h, libs/database/collectionlocation.h,
	  libs/database/collectionmanager.cpp,
	  libs/database/collectionmanager.h: - remove some fields in
	  albuminfo structs
	  
	  - adjust enums
	  - add method to retrieve album path directly from id

2007-10-17 19:07  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/schemaupdater.cpp: Correct SQL, tested on command
	  line

2007-10-17 19:07  mwiesweg

	  digikam/kipiinterface.h, kioslave/digikamalbums.cpp,
	  kioslave/digikamdates.cpp, libs/database/schemaupdater.cpp,
	  libs/dmetadata/dmetadata.cpp: Make compile, adapt to new APIs
	  
	  KipiInterface:
	  - do not access db directly for comment, rating, date, use an
	  ImageInfo object
	  
	  SchemaUpdater:
	  - make the imageid fields primary keys. They are foreign keys,
	  but unique here.
	  
	  DMetadata:
	  - fix XMP strings

2007-10-17 19:07  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/databasefields.h, libs/database/imagecomments.cpp,

2007-10-17 19:06  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/albumdb.cpp, libs/database/albumdb.h: - add main
	  accessor methods for the Images... tables
	  
	  - Audit SQL, adapt to new schema
	  - ensure that datetimes are returned as QDateTimes and not
	  QStrings
	  - add getAllItemDates, which deprecates getItemsAndDates
	  - remove get/setItemDate, get/setItemRating, get/setItemCaption,
	  getAlbumPath

2007-10-17 19:06  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp,
	  libs/database/collectionscanner.h: Add a method scanFile. Was
	  meant for albums ioslave, but now I doubt we need it at all.

2007-10-17 19:06  mwiesweg

	* digikam/albumsettings.cpp, digikam/kipiinterface.cpp,
	  libs/dmetadata/dmetadata.cpp, utilities/cameragui/cameraui.cpp: -

2007-10-17 19:06  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/schemaupdater.cpp, libs/database/schemaupdater.h: -
	  Add an initial implementation of the V4toV5 major schema upgrade
	  - move Images and Albums to new tables - create one AlbumRoot
	  from KConfig info - create file filter settings from KConfig info
	  - TODO: one complete scan - port Rating, Comment, Date (overwrite
	  values read by ImageScanner with those found in the db!)
	  
	  - modify and rearrange parts of the updater logic

2007-10-17 19:06  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/databasebackend.cpp,
	  libs/database/databasebackend.h, libs/database/databasefields.h,
	  libs/database/imagescanner.cpp, libs/database/imagescanner.h:
	  DatabaseBackend:
	  
	  - add a backend method to rollback a transaction (for failed
	  schema update)
	  DatabaseFields:
	  - add Format field to enum
	  - Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS must be moved outside any
	  namespace
	  ImageScanner:
	  - add support for Format and Category to ImageScanner
	  - add a detectFormat method based on DImg detection
	  and KMimeType for the rest
	  - add API docs

2007-10-17 19:06  mwiesweg

	* digikam/scanlib.cpp, digikam/scanlib.h,
	  libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp,
	  libs/database/collectionscanner.h: - properly implement
	  completeScan and partialScan (move detection still missing!)
	  
	  - add detection of removed images
	  - detect category from name filter
	  - load name filters from database
	  - emit signals only when requested
	  - adapt scanlib to the new CollectionScanner:
	  - all scanning is now done from within one method
	  - add some new signals to provide a bit of progress info

2007-10-17 19:05  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/albumdb.cpp, libs/database/albumdb.h,
	  libs/database/albuminfo.h: - add album root id to some info
	  structs
	  
	  - add a number of methods to access file name filter settings in
	  DB
	  - add support for the Format and Category fields
	  - properly implement removeItems, deleteRemovedItems with
	  execBatch

2007-10-17 19:05  mwiesweg

	* libs/dimg/dimg.cpp, libs/dimg/dimg.h: Add a method to retrieve
	  the file format as it was detected in load.
	  
	  Of course, this value only works well for the image formats
	  supported
	  by DImg (but this is 98% for us)

2007-10-17 19:05  mwiesweg

	* CMakeLists.txt, DBSCHEMA.ODS, libs/dmetadata/dmetadata.cpp: Add
	  file.
	  
	  Minor changes in schema.
	  Adapt to header changes in DMetadata.

2007-10-17 19:05  mwiesweg

	  Make compile, temporarily disable access to comments

2007-10-17 19:05  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/albumdb.cpp, libs/database/albumdb.h,
	  libs/database/albuminfo.h: Add methods to update the entry in the
	  Images table, to get the scan info
	  
	  of a single item by imageid, and to add or remove multiple tags
	  to/from multiple
	  images making use of a prepared query and batch execution.

2007-10-17 19:05  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/databasefields.h, libs/database/schemaupdater.cpp,
	  libs/dmetadata/metadatainfo.h: SizeX/SizeY is Width&Height
	  obviously. Add special handling for various comment types.

2007-10-17 19:05  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/imagecomments.cpp, libs/database/imagecomments.h:
	  Add a class dedicated to reading and writing comments.
	  
	  All special handling can go here, in cooperation with
	  ImageScanner.

2007-10-17 19:05  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/imagescanner.cpp, libs/database/imagescanner.h:
	  ImageScanner is a class that is called from the CollectionScanner
	  for scanning an individual file and reading its
	  
	  properties into the database.
	  Previously, this was reading comment, date and rating, now it is
	  a lot more.

2007-10-17 19:04  mwiesweg

	* DBSCHEMA.ODS, libs/database/albumdb.cpp, libs/database/albumdb.h,
	  libs/database/albuminfo.h, libs/database/databasefields.h,
	  libs/database/schemaupdater.cpp: Change the field "source" in the
	  comments table to "type".
	  
	  Now I can give a sane definition of what that means, and I can
	  work much better with this
	  information.

2007-10-17 19:04  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp,
	  libs/database/collectionscanner.h: Restart writing the collection
	  scanner by moving the old code piecewise to a new location

2007-10-17 19:04  mwiesweg

	* DBSCHEMA.ODS, libs/database/schemaupdater.cpp: Some minor changes
	  on the schema:
	  
	  - move orientation to the fourth position so that metadata and
	  image related fields are roughly grouped
	  - remove the album root id from Images table: the relation is via
	  the albumId the albums table
	  - change order in comments
	  - add a UNIQUE clause of which I am not entirely sure yet

2007-10-17 19:04  mwiesweg

	* libs/dimg/dimg.cpp, libs/dimg/dimg.h: typos

2007-10-17 19:04  mwiesweg

	* libs/dmetadata/dmetadata.cpp, libs/dmetadata/metadatainfo.h: Some
	  minor changes on naming convention and returning null, but
	  properly typed QVariants.

2007-10-17 19:04  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/albumdb.cpp, libs/database/albumdb.h,
	  libs/database/albuminfo.h: Add several new methods to AlbumDB to
	  access information in the new image-specific tables.
	  
	  There is now a method to add a new entry foreach table, or to
	  change specific fields.
	  Flags and QVariantLists are used to ease the writing while
	  providing a highly flexible API,
	  else a huge number of methods would be needed.
	  Some other methods are added to add a comments, access the basic
	  Images table for scanning,
	  settings the status of files which are noted as removed on
	  scanning.

2007-10-17 19:04  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/databasefields.h: Add a file with flags for the
	  fields of each of the image-specific tables in the database.
	  
	  This allows to specify to AlbumDB which fields shall be added or
	  modified.

2007-10-17 19:04  mwiesweg

	* DBSCHEMA.ODS, libs/database/schemaupdater.cpp: Some naming
	  changes in DBSCHEMA for more consistency (all Image tables begin
	  with "Image")
	  
	  Synchronize schemaupdater with the DBSCHEMA specification.

2007-10-17 19:03  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/collectionmanager.cpp: Remove old OLDCODE
	  implementation.

2007-10-17 19:03  mwiesweg

	* libs/database/albumdb.cpp: Remove code marked with OLDCODE.
	  
	  No safety belts please. It's getting serious.

2007-10-17 19:03  mwiesweg

	* libs/dmetadata/dmetadata.cpp, libs/dmetadata/dmetadata.h: Add
	  three major new methods to DMetadata:
	  
	  - getMetadataField() returns the value if the specified Field as
	  a QVariant.
	  Shall support everything in the MetadataInfo::Fields enum (some
	  TODO still).
	  To be future proof, the equivalent XMP tag names are included as
	  well.
	  - valueToString: takes a value (no matter if directly from
	  getMetadataField or through DB)
	  and returns a user-presentable, i18n'ed string for it
	  - possibleValuesForEnumField:
	  for those fields with enumerated possible values (mostly from
	  EXIF spec), return a list
	  with possible values and user-presentable value strings.
	  
	  (Change requires the latest additions to libkexiv2)

2007-10-17 19:03  mwiesweg

	* libs/dmetadata/metadatainfo.h: Add a namespaced enum of all those
	  fields that will be retrieved from the metadata of

	  kipi-plugins interface : added comments to pending tasks about to
	  improve
	  kipi-plugins <=> digiKam database pictures attributes
	  interoperability.
	  
	  Marcel, we need 2 new methods on Digikam::AlbumDB class to
	  set/get pictures Tags Path List with kipi-plugins:
	  
	  - AlbumDB::getItemTagPath() to get a strings list of Tags Path
	  assigned to a pictures (Ex.: "City/Paris/Monuments/Notre Dame")
	  - AlbumDB::setItemTagPath() to set Tags Path list to a picture
	  using a string list.
	  
	  The implementation will be certainly similar than
	  Digikam::MetadataHub class. Perhaps a common implementation
	  somewhere must be done.
	  
	  I will use these new methods with RawConverter to clone picture
	  attributes from the RAW pictures to the converted files created
	  by the tool.
	  
	  I'm sure than other kipi-plugins developpers will be interressed
	  by this way... (Colin for ex.)

	* digikam/metadatahub.cpp, libs/database/collectionscanner.cpp,
	  libs/dmetadata/dmetadata.cpp, libs/dmetadata/dmetadata.h: digiKam
	  from trunk (KDE4) : XMP metadata management with database.
	  
	  This is the first stage to control XMP metadata contents with
	  Database contents and vis versa. This code handle XMP with
	  current Database schema witch still the same than 0.9.x.
	  
	  Marcel work currently on the new databse schema describe on the
	  OpenOffice document available at this url :
	  
	  http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/DBSCHEMA.ODS?view=log
	  
	  The code will be adapted later by Marcel to handle more XMP tags
	  according with this new schema.
	  
	  This is the list of current changes :
	  
	  - Preparing code to handle strings hosted in different languages
	  (comments for example, dixit B.K.O #98462).
	  - Handle all Xmp.exif and Xmp.tiff tags has Exif metadata content
	  to get photo information set by camera.
	  - Do not set Iptc.Urgency tag with Rating value, but use standard
	  Xmp.Rating tags instead. Import of Iptc.Urgency
	  as Rating still running if Xmp metadata are not available.
	  (B.K.O: 134206).
	  - Preparing code to handle Xmp strings set different
	  authors(comments for example, dixit B.K.O #134476).
	  - Set the Tags name as Xmp.subject (keywords).
	  - Set the Copyright/Authors information in Xmp tags (schema
	  inspired from Adobe Photoshop 7.0).
	  - Store Tags Path List into a dedicaced digiKam.org Xmp namespace
	  as a sequence of strings. Do not use Iptc.Keywords for that.
	  Import from Iptc still running if Xmp metadata is not available.
	  This way is very important to restore properlly in database all
	  tags assigned to an imported picture. There is not strings size
	  limitation with Xmp and char encoding is always UTF-8. Nothing
	  will be lost now.
	  - Xmp is always stored in pictures format witch support this
	  metadata format : jpeg, png, and tiff.
	  
	  All these changes require to update libkexiv2 and Exiv2 from
	  trunk to compile and run digiKam properlly.

	  digikam/digikamui.rc, project/project.kdevelop: digiKam from
	  trunk (KDE4) : Import menu usability
	  - Import menu is now handle by digikamui.rc file. It's more
	  simple to maintain.
	  - Add Kipi-plugins Import actions in digiKam Import menu instead
	  to plug it to Album menu. This is more clear for end users...
	  - Remove Kipi-plugins Import actions from Album pop-up menu. No
	  need to bloat this part since main Import menu exist.
	  
	  To digiKam team:
	  
	  To be logic, i plan to add a new "Export" menu entry in AlbumGui
	  main menu to plug all kipi-plugins Export actions,
	  and remove all Kipi-plugins Export action from Album menu and
	  pop-up menu. This will improve usability...
	  What do you think about ?

	* utilities/cameragui/gpcamera.cpp: digiKam from trunk (KDE4) :
	  Camera GUI : Give storage media free-space and capacity with
	  Gphoto2 camera.
	  
	  This require libgphoto2 2.4.0 to compile.
	  
	  Tested fine with my Minolta Dynax 5D in PTP mode
	  Test fail with my Olympus C3000Z (pure GPhoto2 drivers) because
	  this camera do not support this feature.
	  
	  I need more feedback from users if you use Gphoto2 drivers (all
	  Canon cameras for ex.). Thanks in advance...
	  
	  Note: digiKam for KDE4 need mandatory libgphoto2 2.4.0 to
	  compile. There is no way to get libgphoto2 major/minor/patch
	  revision during compilation.
	  digiKam for KDE3 implementation still compatible with all
	  libgphoto2 release because it don't provide this new function in
	  Camera Gui.

	* DBSCHEMA.ODS: - add more Exif, IPTC and XMP tags to specify where
	  the data can be read from
	  - fill some "read from", "written to", "changed by" fields
	  - add table for copyright/author information. This table still
	  needs a good name.
	  - add ImageProperties table
	  - move Haar matrix to an extra table. The matrix is probably
	  large, its creation options,
	  so it is better kept separate.
	  - add a page with some thoughts on the integration of IPTC Core
	  and Dublin Core.
	  Infos taken from XMP specs.

	* digikam/digikamapp.cpp, digikam/digikamapp.h,
	  digikam/digikamappprivate.h: Add support for autodetection of
	  gphoto2 cameras with Solid.
	  As for USM cameras, all other cameras supported by Solid will
	  now be detected dynamically and appear in the menu when they are
	  connected.
	  
	  The cameras added manually are moved to their own submenu.
	  Adding manually _should_ now only be necessary for serial port
	  devices.
	  
	  Note 1: This needs testing.
	  Note 2: I am not sure about the right solution when no devices
	  are connected:
	  Should the submenu be hidden, disabled (current solution) or
	  one entry be added "No device connected"?
	  Note 3: This requires kdelibs at least revision 704641, later
	  than last monday (27.8.)
	  A necessary method in Solid was added only then.

	  Camera Gui improvements : camera interface is now based on
	  KXmlGuiWindow instead KDialog.
	  
	  By this way, the interface is more homogenous with the rest of
	  digiKam (album gui, light table, image editor). It will
	  be more easy to add new options in interface using standard menu
	  (the old one been very limited to 3 simple buttons to
	  host options). The layout is now fully optimized to preserve
	  space between widget.
	  
	  This version use a status bar where a progress bar is used when
	  camera is busy. A zoom widget set the thumbs size, and a
	  naviguate bar set set current item selected in icon view.
	  
	  With this version, XMP metadata viewer is available.
	  
	  It's planed to use this new interface to import new pictures from
	  everywhere (not only from camera). Currently digiKam
	  use a very limited dialog to import files/folders without any
	  import options.

	  - allow to load only metadata fields and not the actual image
	  data
	  - Add a method to retrieve a unique hash from a file. This hash
	  is very much like what Amarok
	  uses for file identification, and the purpose is to be fast and
	  unique.
	  Similarity detection is _not_ possible with this hash - for this,
	  we will use a Haar-like algorithm.

	  to scanning.
	  
	  Previously, all files were taken in the database, and only after
	  listing from the db,
	  files were filtered by the file suffixes.
	  With this change, as discussed on the devel list quite some time
	  ago,
	  files are filtered by suffix before they are taken up in the
	  database,
	  and filtering after listing is not necessary.
	  
	  This accommodates better to the view that all entries in the db
	  are part of the collection,
	  and it solves some bugs when SQL features are used to get
	  statistics from db.
	  
	  TODO:
	  The situation in the config dialog needs to be cleared. At least
	  there must be a big fat
	  warning if users try to remove "*.jpg" and the like, as they
	  would lose their tags.
	  Second, after a change, a rescan is needed.
	  We should anyway think about the format list, when raw formats
	  are added, old users may not see them.
	  There could be a "use default values" check - and only with this
	  unchecked, the formats would be configurable.

	* libs/database/databasebackend.cpp,

	  remove old code accessing libsqlite3 directly.
	  
	  The switch is long planned. There are no major code changes, the
	  database backend
	  provides mostly a drop-in replacement for the old API.
	  It gives us a clean and complete Qt API, and I want to
	  use prepared query to try to speed up some batch operations.
	  If we decide in the future that we want to support MySQL, here we
	  have the support
	  for free by Qt.

	  loading:
	  AlbumIconView uses ThumbnailLoadThread now.
	  
	  Previously, we used to load thumbnails with an ioslave and

	  This overhead can be avoided now.
	  
	  The new classes ThumbnailLoadThread and ThumbnailCreator have the
	  functionality that was
	  contained in the digikamthumbnail ioslave and the classes
	  ThumbnailJob and PixmapManager.
	  ThumbnailJob/ioslave is still used in other parts of digikam.
	  PixmapManager is now unused.
	  
	  Subjectively, thumbnail loading feels faster in certain
	  situations for me.

	  This was quite a major undertaking. But no, we
	  have a very nice menu with a checkbox on the left, followed by
	  icon and
	  text.
	  Even the submenus have a checkbox.
	  All this is done by drawing directly with QStyle, so it needs to
	  be tested.
	  
	  TODO:
	  You will notice that the menu frame on the right is not drawn.
	  Actually there is code that draws it, but I dont know why it is
	  not visible.

	* digikam/albumfolderview.cpp, digikam/albumicongroupitem.cpp,
	  digikam/datefolderview.cpp, digikam/monthwidget.cpp: Patches
	  written by John Layt to:
	  
	  1) Add some new methods to KCalendarClass API to match QDate4, to
	  support
	  proper date range validation, and help app programmers implement
	  their own
	  calendar systems.
	  
	  2) Change the date range limits hard-coded into KCalendarSystem
	  to match
	  QDate4 or each calendars epoch, as appropriate.
	  
	  3) Clean up the KCalendarSystem implementations to be simpler,
	  more
	  consistant, and to share more code (and add unit tests!)
	  
	  4) Modify KDateWidget, KDateTable and KDatePicker API (& BIC?) to
	  allow
	  multiple calender systems to be displayed at the same time, as
	  well as do
	  code clean-up.

	* libs/imageproperties/imagedescedittab.cpp: digiKam from trunk
	  (KDE4) : this is the last shared part to port used by digiKam to
	  run Album GUI.
	  
	  All part are now ported to KDE4 : LightTable, Image Editor,
	  Camera Interface, Batch Tools, sldeshow, libs, etc...
	  Now we will complete the port to work on digiKam Album GUI
	  implementation...
	  
	  Marcel, Laurent: in imagedescedittab.cpp, the code relevant of
	  KAdressBook shared lib to handle contacts is temporally
	  commented. On my computer, i cannot get libkabc to make the port.
	  It's not really a problem. It's few lines of code which can be
	  ported later.

	  There is an indeep bug in this widget ported to KDE4 which crash
	  showfoto. Need to investiguate...
	  
	  Laurent, SqueezedComboBox KDE4 port have be done by KOffice team.
	  To be clear, this widget have been created by digiKam in the
	  past,
	  used in Koffice and ported to KDE4 as well. I have just
	  backported this KDE4 port in digiKam without check the
	  implementation.
	  
	  Perhaps it will better to do a common widget in kdelibs...

	  there will be a race condition if the thread is started from the
	  constructor.
	  For this reason, threaded filter now needs to be started with
	  startFilter.
	  Chained filters (used in another threaded filter) are still
	  directly started.
	  API is now:
	  initFilter()
	  startFilter()
	  startFilterDirectly()
	  cancelFilter()

	  Large parts of the code are taken from qshareddata.h (hence the
	  slightly different copyright header - GPL v2 only)
	  This code uses QAtomic methods, but it is from a _public header_
	  which means that
	  the API used there - even if not officially documented - will not
	  be subject to change (to keep BC).
	  
	  The class still needs to be tested - it only compiles.

	  Marcel, do you remember your nice hack in 2006 about DImg memory

	  Well, it's time to study again (a litlle) if Qt3::QShared class

	  Temporally, we will use Q3Shared transition class.

2007-06-13 21:46  mwiesweg

	* project/project.kdevelop: Well I dont know where this file got
	  lost in the branching process, but here it is again

2007-06-13 21:41  mwiesweg

	* .: Move the db-consolidation branch from
	  branches/work/digikam-dbconsolidation
	  to trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam.
	  The branch has all changes merged from its creation point
	  to the current state of branches/extragear/kde3/graphics/digikam.

2007-06-13 21:29  mwiesweg

	* Merge to 675264

2007-06-13 21:19  mwiesweg

	* Disable these lines for the time being to use digikam3.db when
	  porting

2007-06-13 19:01  mwiesweg

	* Restore the ability to change album root / album library path
	  from setup
	  Add very basic command line option to specify a different album
	  root
	  Clean up

2007-06-13 18:59  mwiesweg

	* Clean up code, remove outcommented lines, remove stale file

2007-06-13 16:29  cgilles

	* add list of priority order to port digiKam under KDE4

2007-06-11 10:32  cgilles

	* compile with enable-final option

2007-06-10 21:01  mwiesweg

	* Merge to 673684

2007-06-10 20:58  mwiesweg

	* Add API docs

2007-06-08 21:56  cgilles

	* add list of dir to port under KDE4

2007-06-08 20:42  mwiesweg

	* Adapt to changed API

2007-06-08 20:41  mwiesweg

	* Merge the two collection scanning methods.
	  There was one group of methods from the ioslave, and one group
	  from scanlib.
	  Functionality was essentially the same.
	  The current method is mostly the scanlib one with some parts from
	  the ioslave,
	  but it did not really matter.

2007-06-08 20:38  mwiesweg

	* - make arguments const &
	  - add isAlbumRoot

2007-06-05 17:20  mwiesweg

	* Merge to 671870

2007-06-03 16:33  mwiesweg

	* Merge to 671036.

2007-06-03 16:14  mwiesweg

	* Forward-port added method, but directly using SQL

2007-05-31 09:42  cgilles

	* compile

2007-05-31 09:37  cgilles

	* digikam from db-consolidation branch : Marcel, for obscurs
	  reasons, 'albumdb_sqlite2.cpp' must be compiled just after
	  'albumdb.cpp' when './configure --enable-final' is used.

2007-05-30 21:27  mwiesweg

	* SQL2 to SQL3 is now handled in libs/database.
	  Use lastError() from Database access when reporting to user.
	  Make compile

2007-05-30 21:26  mwiesweg

	* Change default file to digikam4.db for now.
	  Add convenience isSQLite()
	  Make compile

2007-05-30 21:25  mwiesweg

	* Add full error message handling.
	  Integrate schema updater

2007-05-30 21:24  mwiesweg

	* Add the status() method, better than single isOpen/isReady
	  Some API changes and adapt to schema updater

2007-05-30 21:22  mwiesweg

	* Forward-port changes from trunk

2007-05-30 21:22  mwiesweg

	* Add the first real schema updating.
	  
	  All previous versions do not contain code to detect database
	  schemas,
	  this means they cannot find out that a database is in a future
	  schema
	  that they cannot read. For this reason, first step is to copy the
	  digikam3.db
	  file to digikam4.db.
	  Further schema changes are not yet implemented, but from now on
	  they can be done
	  on this file.
	  I am open for discussions on compatibility issues in the future,
	  this is only a first implementation.

2007-05-30 21:18  mwiesweg

	* Move these classes to libs/database.
	  Remove when Qt4 provides SQL2 drivers?

2007-05-26 12:25  mwiesweg

	* Forward-port change by Gilles in trunk

2007-05-25 12:39  cgilles

	* digikam from db-consolidation branch : Marcel, just missing the
	  "(C)" statement on header... Nothing more (:=)))

2007-05-15 20:07  mwiesweg

	* Fix headers

2007-05-14 20:34  mwiesweg

	* Fixing headers

2007-05-14 20:25  mwiesweg

	* Merge to 664763.

2007-05-13 17:11  mwiesweg

	* Merge to 664316

2007-05-11 17:12  mwiesweg

	* Merge to 663574.

2007-05-10 20:27  mwiesweg

	* Fix the signals. Giving up using the enum verbatim as signal
	  parameter, leads
	  to much confusion from my side. int works just as well.

2007-05-07 18:09  mwiesweg

	* Merge to 662249.

2007-05-07 18:03  mwiesweg

	* Merge to 661754.

2007-05-06 14:16  mwiesweg

	* Port to API changes

2007-05-06 14:16  mwiesweg

	* Create a new bottom-up way of change notification.
	  Grouping of messages in the higher levels is still a todo.

2007-05-06 14:15  mwiesweg

	* Add shared data to all ImageInfo objects.
	  A central cache keeps access to the shared data and updates it
	  when changes occur.
	  ImageInfo objects can be copied very fast. Their data is updated
	  from bottom-up, not top-down as currently.

2007-04-21 16:49  mwiesweg

	* Merge to revision 656534.

2007-04-21 16:47  mwiesweg

	* Use AlbumDB instead of direct SQL statements:
	  CollectionScanner is now execSQL-free

2007-04-21 16:47  mwiesweg

	* Add to new methods to AlbumDB:
	  - getSubalbumsForPath
	  - getAlbumShortInfos
	  
	  Move the ShortInfo structs to albuminfo.h

2007-04-21 16:45  mwiesweg

	* Provide a proper DatabaseUrl to ioslave for scannig: it is a
	  directory, need a slash in file url.

2007-04-21 14:53  mwiesweg

	* - fix uninitialized memory in databaseaccess
	  - add method to retrieve name and album data from Image id in one
	  call,
	  used by ImageInfo

2007-04-21 14:47  mwiesweg

	* Move database initialization to AlbumManager, with user feedback
	  on error

2007-04-17 19:22  mwiesweg

	* Porting to new classes

2007-04-17 19:21  mwiesweg

	* Porting to DatabaseBackend and SchemaUpdater.
	  AlbumDB is now mostly a place which contains SQL code,
	  no more backend code. (In the future, creating the SQL code will
	  be moved to a central class as well, allowing for database engine
	  specific
	  subclasses.)

2007-04-17 19:19  mwiesweg

	* Introducing a class to update the database schema if necessary.
	  The schema has not yet changed, so it does not do any upgrading.

2007-04-17 19:18  mwiesweg

	* Separating database-specific code into backend classes:
	  Introducing new class abstract DatabaseBackend and the
	  implementation for SQLite3.

2007-04-14 15:13  mwiesweg

	* Merge to revision 653913.

2007-04-14 15:11  mwiesweg

	* Porting the rest to CollectionManager.
	  
	  Currently, changing the album root in option is not immediately
	  reflected.
	  Clearing the view history on a change is a TODO as well.

2007-04-14 15:09  mwiesweg

	* These are the places where new albums are created.
	  When the user chooses to create a new album under root, in the
	  future,
	  there are two possibilities:
	  (1) ask under which album root path to create
	  (2) have one default path
	  
	  Currently, CollectionManager::oneAlbumRoot() is used, which is
	  option (2).

2007-04-14 15:07  mwiesweg

	* AlbumManager::getLibraryPath is dead!
	  Require and album root path when creating an album under root.
	  Use CollectionManager where appropriate.
	  SQL2ToSQL3 is waiting to be moved (or removed?)

2007-04-14 14:57  mwiesweg

	* Adapt PAlbum to provide and album root path.
	  Revise url methods.

2007-04-14 14:55  mwiesweg

	* Provide an album root path and use collection manager in more
	  places

2007-04-14 14:54  mwiesweg

	* Introducing the CollectionManager.
	  This is the first step to support a collection spread over
	  multiple locations
	  (multiple library paths in current wording).
	  The CollectionManager implementation is mostly a fake though,
	  only one location is supported.
	  A real implemenation requires a database table, and the KDE4
	  Solid API.

2007-04-09 16:24  mwiesweg

	* polish

2007-04-08 14:41  mwiesweg

	* Merge to 651584

2007-04-07 17:55  mwiesweg

	* Use CollectionScanner directly now

2007-04-07 17:55  mwiesweg

	* The actual scanning and database code from scanlib is now moved
	  to CollectionScanner.
	  The ScanLib class now provides the GUI wrapper (progress display)
	  based on signals emitted from the CollectionScanner

2007-04-07 17:53  mwiesweg

	* Move ScanLib code to CollectionScanner

2007-04-07 17:50  mwiesweg

	* The album root should not contain a trailing slash.

2007-04-07 17:50  mwiesweg

	* Add convenience method albumRootPath

2007-04-07 17:49  mwiesweg

	* Add albumRoot parameters to getAlbumForPath. This parameters is
	  currently unused
	  in the implementation, but will be needed in the future.

2007-04-06 14:13  mwiesweg

	* Make digikamtags work: Need to specify a database url, increment
	  iterator.
	  Make compile: Use Namefilter, remove call to setAlbumRoot

2007-04-06 12:56  mwiesweg

	* Fix crash at shutdown

2007-04-06 12:56  mwiesweg

	* Remove extra call DatabaseParameters::setAlbumRoot.
	  Set the album root when parameters are set.
	  In fact, the global album root shall be removed as fast as
	  possible.
	  
	  Listing tags and searches works now.

2007-04-06 11:42  mwiesweg

	* Merge to revision 651054.

2007-04-02 21:09  mwiesweg

	* Tiny change, but at least listing of albums works now

2007-04-02 21:08  mwiesweg

	* Remove methods now in NameFilter

2007-04-02 21:08  mwiesweg

	* The methods "makeFilterList" and "matchFilter" have been moved in
	  this class

2007-04-02 21:07  mwiesweg

	* make compile, add target for fast installation

2007-04-02 18:31  mwiesweg

	* Merging with trunk 648861:649474

2007-04-01 14:39  mwiesweg

	* Porting the ioslaves. This means:
	  
	  - Removing huge amounts of code, which is now in libs/database
	  - For the digikamalbums ioslave, strict separation of the file
	  and database operations.
	  The file operations should if possible be done by the file://
	  ioslave, if they can be chained.

2007-04-01 14:35  mwiesweg

	* This is a temporary solution: Mainly a copy of the
	  ImageAttributesWatch

2007-04-01 14:35  mwiesweg

	* compile it!

2007-04-01 14:34  mwiesweg

	* This class is currently not more than an inherited QPtrList, but
	  I imagine it to do some
	  cool things in the future: auto-updating and batch operations.

2007-04-01 14:33  mwiesweg

	* Helper class to facilitate database transactions

2007-04-01 14:33  mwiesweg

	* This is the code from the digikamsearch: ioslave to build SQL
	  queries from a URL search description.

2007-04-01 14:32  mwiesweg

	* Classes supporting the ImageLister class

2007-04-01 14:31  mwiesweg

	* All code from the four db ioslaves listing files from the db
	  (except for search query building) will now be concentrated in
	  this file.

2007-04-01 14:30  mwiesweg

	* Dumping all collection scanning code in this file. Scanlib is
	  still missing!
	  Awaiting further restructuring.

2007-04-01 14:28  mwiesweg

	* This is a simple parameters wrapper to pass all parameters
	  necessary
	  to specify a database connection. Not specific to SQLite, rather
	  inspired
	  by the Qt 4 SQL API and thus as generaly as it gets.

2007-04-01 14:27  mwiesweg

	* This is the new core database class that provides access to the
	  database object and allows safe access in a multithreaded
	  situation.

2007-04-01 14:25  mwiesweg

	* This class shall ease and unify the usage of digikamalbums:/,
	  digikamtags:/, digikamdates:/ and digikamsearch: URLs.

2007-04-01 14:24  mwiesweg

	* The files have been copied from the digikam directory. Port
	  ImageInfo to the new architecture.

2007-04-01 14:22  mwiesweg

	* Add the database directory as the location for all future
	  database code

2007-04-01 14:17  mwiesweg

	  value using the canvas size... and at the first time to launch
	  editor, the size is null... result : zoom factor is infinite,
	  duing a division calculation (i'm so surprize to not have an "div
	  by 0" exception...)
	  
	  This patch fix this problem. Normally, with autozoom, the image
	  will be always displayed.

	  Gerhard,
	  
	  I have found an indeep bug into the Renchi algorithm about Alpha
	  channel rule used to merge red pixels mask and original image.
	  With the new implementation, we can use a gaussian blur effect on
	  the mask to polish the pupil border. With the old implementation,
	  all the mask is blured. With the new, only the pupil pixels are
	  blured.
	  
	  I have add a new "Smooth" adjsutment witch can control the
	  gaussian blur effect. The result are very nice (:=)))...
	  
	  Question: I think than the "Agressive" settings is obsolete now.
	  What do you think about ?

	  The first new feature is to add a depency to libkdcraw shared
	  library to decode RAW pictures instead to use a dcraw part from
	  digiKam core.
	  libkdcraw include dcraw 8.60 instead the old dcraw 8.41 from
	  digiKam core. It support more recent camera RAW file formats and
	  provide a new wavelet noise reduction filter.
	  
	  If you want more information about libkdcraw, take a look into
	  my blog : http://www.digikam.org/?q=node/208
	  
	  To packagers : please update your packages rules about this new
	  depency

	  Tool using Preview feature !
	  
	  Hi guys, you can slide your RAW files very fast like this !!!
	  
	  This slide show tool is a simplified version of kipi-plugins
	  SlideShow tool. No effect, no OpenGL. Just the picture slided on
	  the screen.
	  
	  But the must important feature is to use Image Preview : RAW
	  files can be slided and pictures saved by digiKam image editor
	  will be loaded very fast because we use preview image embeded in
	  IPTC metadata (that the kipi-plugins cannot do it).
	  
	  This slide show tool run always in fullscreen mode. this have
	  simplified the common EditorWindow class implementation.
	  
	  This slide show tool is available in Image Editor and Showfoto
	  instead the old one. Added it to Album Gui is not a problem. It's
	  very easy to add the right action on the main window menu.
	  
	  Luka, If you want to do it before 0.9.1-Beta1, let's go to, and
	  close files #135655, #140303, #140304. thanks in advance...

	* kioslave/digikamthumbnail.cpp, libs/dimg/loaders/rawloader.cpp:
	  Disable the use of the DImg raw loader when loading as DImg from
	  digikamthumbnail ioslave.
	  
	  We are using KProcess for the raw loader and make two
	  assumptions:
	  - there is an event loop (not for ioslaves)
	  - the loader is not called from the event loop thread (currently
	  no use case in digikam)
	  
	  The DImg raw loader is not needed - DcrawIface is called before.
	  So the problem of the loader entering an endless loop (because no
	  events from KProcess
	  are delivered) arises only if a file is identified as RAW, but
	  dcraw does not
	  support it.

	  in the UI (grey text). The user can change such a value for all
	  pictures, or leave
	  it untouched.
	  
	  Additionally, there is a button "More" which allows a batch
	  operation for the
	  currently selected pictures, either Metadata->database or
	  database->metadata
	  (the latter only for multiple selection, for single selection
	  this is equivalent
	  to pressing the apply button).
	  
	  Problems and pending tasks:
	  - test it
	  - the Image Properties tab currently still displays only the
	  first picture. It needs to
	  support a multiple-selection mode with at least the file system
	  properties.
	  - the "More" button may clutter the UI, better implementations
	  welcome
	  - in the navigate bar all four buttons are disabled. Perhaps hide
	  them, but without
	  making the whole layout jump (I didn't know how to do that)
	  - it would be nice if the number in "Editing 25 pictures" could
	  be bold, but KSqueezedText
	  does not allow rich text
	  - if a tag is added from IPTC metadata and newly created in DB,
	  it is unchecked initially in ImageDescEditTab. Need to debug.
	  - metadata update notification currently always reloads if no
	  changes are made, and does nothing
	  if modified. For multiple selection more refined solutions are
	  too complex. Perhaps it's ok like this.

	  way been wrong because it hardcoded directly on image algorithm
	  the indicator witch have a side effect on preview histogram!
	  - Now, the widget witch render on the screen the preview image
	  will render the over and under exposure indicator : advantages :
	  * preview is render more fast because the corrected image is not
	  recomputed.
	  * target image histogram is not affected by the over-colored area
	  depending of unde/over exposed pixels !
	  - Add 2 new buttons on the top right corner of preview area to
	  toggle on/off the indicators.
	  - Like the preview widget is common of all image plugins, all
	  will support automaticly this new feature. Thanks to C++ (:=)))

	  in digiKam source code.
	  Theses one redefine 'enum' type (or something like that) and
	  broke compilation with final compilation option.
	  
	  If you check why X11 header is used in digiKam core (excepted
	  with theme implementation) you can see one
	  X11 method is called to check if CTRL or ALT keys are pressed,
	  especially with D&D stuff. I think we
	  can use Qt API instead everywhere. What do you think about ?

	  digiKam from trunk : native support of JPEG2000 file format.
	  
	  JPEG2000 is an advanced picture compression file format based on
	  wavelet theory. It support 16 bits/color/pixel, metadata, and ICC
	  color profile. Look url below for more information:
	  
	  http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper
	  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000
	  http://www.geocities.com/ee00224/btp2.html
	  http://www.photozone.de/7Digital/jpeg2000.htm
	  
	  Still TODO with this JPEG2000 loader :
	  
	  - The JPEG2000 quality level settings is the same than JPEG in
	  setup dialog. We need to create a dedicaced widget settings for
	  each digiKam image loader (TIFF/PNG/JPEG/JPEG2000). There is a
	  file in B.K.O about this subject.
	  - YCbCr color space is not yet supported. In fact, because
	  digiKam support only RGB* color space, we need to have an ICC
	  color method to transform non-RGB* color space to RGB* using lcms
	  libary for all image file formats witch can do use it
	  (JPEG/JPEG2000/TIFF).
	  - Embedding ICC color profile doesn't work. It implemented but
	  something still wrong.
	  - JPEG2000 Metadata extraction (EXIF/IPTC) not yet done in Exiv2.
	  
	  To packagers : digiKam have a new library depency : libJasper.

	  utilities/imageeditor/editor/imageiface.cpp: digikam from trunk:
	  fix in color management :
	  
	  - To be abble to use CM is no input color profile is set in CM
	  setup. In this case, we use built-in sRGB color profile from
	  lcms. This will be enough for 0.9.0. Paco, perhaps we must
	  provide an option into CM setup to choose the right mode between
	  "built-in" or "from input icc file". Krita run like this.
	  
	  - By default, using the CM plugin with RAW file instead Color
	  correction dialog.
	  Paco, in fact, I think it's a a non-sence to use ColorCorrection
	  with RAW file. A common option in CM setup is certainly better
	  than 2 separate options : if user choose "Ask when open an image
	  in Image editor" option, well digikam will start CM plugin if the
	  image is a RAW file, or if its JPEG/TIFF/PNG it will start Color
	  correction dialog.
	  
	  - Fix Color Managed View (for Monitor) color management. In fact
	  this mode do not work properlly before this commit, because the
	  input profile is the camera profile. This is wrong with managed
	  view : the input profile must be the workspace profile. This is
	  why some users have reported a wrong color rendering if this
	  option is enable.
	  
	  Paco, please let's me here your comments if necessary. Please
	  update your TODO accordinly for future actions later 0.9.0 final
	  release.

	  This commit check IPTC keywords contents to tag pictures in

	  intrusive to database. No new tag is created.
	  
	  A second step will be done to create new tags if current keywords

	  and the implementation need to be checked indeep to prevent
	  indeep problems. Still TODO.
	  
	  Note to digikam users: i need Jpeg pictures to test :
	  
	  - witch have been tagged using digikam and tags saved in IPTC
	  keywords.
	  - witch have been tagged to IPTC keywords using another

	  Problems to fix:
	  - when removing many images with the tag filter, the GUI would
	  hang
	  Try with >1000 tagged images and filter with "Not tagged" - it
	  took
	  more than a minute with full CPU, now 500 ms
	  - improve GUI responsiveness when selecting images in
	  AlbumIconView,
	  especially with key presses or keeping the key pressed
	  
	  Fixes:
	  - use a QTimer to decouple the selection signal from
	  AlbumIconView
	  and setting the right side bar in AlbumView.
	  Using 75 ms.
	  - set a wait cursor when filtering large numbers of images with
	  tag filter
	  (here it is 500 ms for 1000 images)
	  No cursor for small numbers of images.
	  - emit a signalSelectionChanged from IconView when the last image
	  has been
	  removed (and no image is selected any more)
	  - disconnect signalItemDeleted(AlbumIconItem*) from DigikamView's
	  signal_noCurrentItem
	  - when all items are removed, make sure that the contents size
	  is updated (to 0x0)

	  - <Shift+Del> brings up the permanently-delete dialog without an
	  option
	  - there are hidden actions for delete without confirmation to
	  which power users can assign shortcuts
	  - the current setup option whether to trash or permanently delete
	  is removed from the setup
	  - it is kept internally and used for album deletion, see below
	  - add a new setup option which is identical to the "Do not ask
	  again" option is the trash
	  dialog, so that this setting is reversible
	  - added to AlbumSettings as well
	  - in the AlbumFolderView, if deleting a whole album,
	  only the context menu can be used to select a delete operation -
	  Shift+Del is reserved for images.
	  Here, the user can choose in the dialog whether to trash or
	  delete permanently. This setting is stored.
	  No "Do not ask again" will be available.
	  - all subalbums will be included in the list in the DeleteDialog
	  to make the user aware that
	  he deletes them as well
	  - fix a bug in ImageWindow slotDeleteCurrent with directories
	  that contain a "#"
	  - The DeleteDialog has now five modes of operation, see above.
	  The checkboxes
	  are in a widget stack, all the functionality that was there is
	  still there for future needs.

	  improvement : first approach to itentify the NEW pictures taken

	  digiKam now store in the camera XML config file the "last camera
	  used date". Each camera are tagged with a date value between
	  camera gui sessions if some pictures have been donwloaded to
	  computer. If no pictures are donloaded with camera gui, the date
	  is unchanged.
	  
	  In fact, all picture dates in the camera witch are most recent
	  than the "last camera used date" will be displayed with a little
	  yellow start to indentify the most recent pictures taken with the
	  camera.
	  
	  To use properlly this little feature, you need to set the right
	  date in your camera !
	  
	  Of course, this way cannot be used to identify the pictures
	  "already downloaded" from camera to computer. For that, we need
	  to have a full camera activity log somewhere (perhaps using the
	  digiKam database).
	  
	  I'm waiting your comments about to implement camera log feature
	  in digiKam.

	* digikam/iconview.cpp: digikam from trunk : general improvements
	  of icon view reactivity !
	  
	  This commit is simple : during items selection using mouse
	  draging, it dispatch the current icons selection event only when
	  user have release the left mouse.
	  
	  Before this commit the implementation sent an event when a new
	  item have been selected during the selection (under the mouse
	  draging with the left button pressed). I other word, the gui will
	  recieve a lot of events to refresh the sidebar. This way
	  decreased the gui reactivity when metadata/properties sidebar is
	  enable. This problem exist also with the Camera Gui. The problem
	  is more important in this case because the data exanged between
	  the computer and the camera will be important to extract metadata
	  for each camera items.
	  
	  IMPORTANT : I have tested digiKam Album Gui and Camera Gui with
	  this fix. All work fine but i would to have a right feedback from
	  the team before to valid this change for the next 0.9.0-beta2
	  planed to september.
	  
	  Thanks in advance for your reports.

	  In fact the interface to upload into gphoto2 camera have been
	  never removed but the interface with the new digiKam folder view
	  have never written by renchi.
	  
	  All camera type are supported : Gphoto2, PTP, UMS, etc. This
	  implementation have been tested with my Olympus C3000Z and my
	  Minolta Dynax 5D.
	  
	  By this commit, there is 2 ways to upload pictures in your camera
	  :
	  
	  - Drag & drop between digiKam main interface (or quesror if you
	  want), and camera interface.
	  - Copy and Paste like between digiKam album.
	  
	  Todo : add a new 'Upload' button on the bottom of Camera
	  Interface. I need a feedback from user before to do it... This
	  one is really mandatory ?
	  
	  Note : with Gphoto2 camera, check if the camera dirver support
	  upload using the new camera info dialog available by Camera
	  Interface Help menu.

	  Marcel, this bug is very important to fix before beta1 :
	  
	  http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130525
	  
	  I'm very confuse about the comments into B.K.O. Why we have this
	  problem now ? I have tested indeep the JPEGLoader::save() method
	  in the past...
	  
	  After to have suspected a problem in DMetadata/Exiv2, i suspect
	  now a problem with the libjpeg implementation. Perhaps the record
	  of the icc profile isn't at the right place for example (i have
	  already this problem with libtiff in the past).
	  
	  Your viewpoint will be very appreciate (:=)))

	  Tom, please try again to use camera gui with your Fuji RAW files

	  and give me a feedback.
	  
	  Note that in this case, the RAW thumb extraction will be very

	  will fix it by a new commit after your feedback.

	* libs/dmetadata/dmetadata.cpp: digikam from trunk : DMetadata :
	  improving getImageOrientation method with Minolta cameras using
	  Camera settings from MakerNote. Minolta is the only maker (i
	  think) to set un-properlly the Exif image orientation tag and to
	  use MakerNote tag instead. Note this information is used to
	  rotate properlly album item thumbs !
	  
	  This commit fix this problem with Dynax 7D and 5D cameras. Other
	  minolta Camera settings need to be decrypted (under Exiv2
	  implementation) to improve this way. Since i'm also an Exiv2
	  developer, i can fix easily the implementation, but i need a
	  feedback from Minolta users for that (reverse engeenering into
	  A1, X1, DImage, etc. cameras)

	  - Fix DMetadata method to get image Exif/Iptc tags properlly.
	  (With the old implementation, Comments from Exif and Iptc, Rating
	  from Iptc and are never checked duing a wrong validity test -
	  stupid bug)
	  - Now at startup, these information are backported to database :
	  
	  ==> Comments from JFIF section, or Exif UserComments tag, or Iptc
	  Caption tag.
	  ==> Date & time stamp from Exif dateTime tag or Iptc date & time
	  tags.
	  ==> Rating from Iptc Urgency tag !!! If you add new files in your
	  Album library, witch are rated using Mapivi for example, digiKam
	  items rating will be appear in main interface.
	  
	  Nota : these updates in database are only performed to new files
	  :
	  
	  ==> when all albums are parsed during statup (or manually from
	  Tool menu).
	  ==> when new items are downloaded using camera interface.
	  ==> when a folder is imported from main interface.
	  
	  TODO :
	  
	  - Performed a database update at startup when files are already
	  in database and when metadata have been changed outside digiKam
	  (using ExifTools for example)
	  - Do something with digiKam Tags, since they are stored in IPTC
	  Keywords tags. This is most complicated to do because there is no
	  hierarchy between IPTC Keywords like with digiKam tags. We store
	  only Tags name in IPTC keywords. I propose :
	  
	  ==> to check if a digiKam tags name already exist in database and
	  taging automaticly item using it.
	  ==> do nothing if Tags name do not exist (no new digiKam Tags
	  will be created in database).
	  ==> If dupplicate Tags name exist in digiKam database (for ex.
	  Travel/City and Travel/France/City), use only the first Tag name
	  found in database.
	  
	  digiKam Tags <==> IPTC Keywords rules is a complex problem.

	  The ImageEditor can now access the database independently
	  from main view, i.e. also if main moved to a different directory.
	  
	  - adjust ImageInfo to be more like a database item wrapper class
	  - add a method to ImageWindow to start it with a list of
	  ImageInfo objects, use this in AlbumIconView
	  - adapt ImageWindow to (optional) ImageInfo list
	  - adjust behavior of saveAsIsComplete
	  - add itemChanged methods to ImagePropertiesSidebarDB:
	  - one takes only a URL (no database)
	  - one takes an ImageInfo object (used by ImageWindow, full DB
	  support)
	  - one takes AlbumIconItem and -View (used by main view,
	  full DB support, optional future interaction with the view)
	  - ImageDescEditTab now works on an ImageInfo object
	  - add a copyItem method to ImageInfo as a wrapper for said
	  function from AlbumDB
	  - modify AlbumDB::copyItem to return image id of inserted image
	  - add DISTINCT keyword to second SELECT statement of
	  AlbumDB::copyItem.
	  With all of above changes, I constantly produced bug #113915.
	  I do not know why the SELECT statement produces (in my case)
	  three times
	  the same result so that INSERT complains, and I do not know which
	  of
	  my changes should ever trigger this problem, but the DISTINCT
	  fixes this.
	  If anyone speaks SQL, you might want to check my comment in
	  AlbumDB::copyItem.
	  
	  Currently, the rating is not copied when database information is
	  copied (in copyItem).
	  Should this be done?

	  digikam from trunk : improving image properties restoration in
	  database using image metadata:
	  
	  - Fix DMetadata method to get image Exif/Iptc tags properlly.
	  (With the old implementation, Comments from Exif and Iptc, Rating
	  from Iptc and are never checked duing a wrong validity test -
	  stupid bug)
	  - Now at startup, these information are backported to database :
	  
	  ==> Comments from JFIF section, or Exif UserComments tag, or Iptc
	  Caption tag.
	  ==> Date & time stamp from Exif dateTime tag or Iptc date & time
	  tags.
	  ==> Rating from Iptc Urgency tag !!! If you add new files in your
	  Album library, witch are rated using Mapivi for example, digiKam
	  items rating will be appear in main interface.
	  
	  Nota : these updates in database are only performed to new files
	  :
	  
	  ==> when all albums are parsed during statup (or manually from
	  Tool menu).
	  ==> when new items are downloaded using camera interface.
	  ==> when a folder is imported from main interface.
	  
	  TODO :
	  
	  - Performed a database update at startup when files are already
	  in database and when metadata have been changed outside digiKam
	  (using ExifTools for example)
	  - Do something with digiKam Tags, since they are stored in IPTC
	  Keywords tags. This is most complicated to do because there is no
	  hierarchy between IPTC Keywords like with digiKam tags. We store
	  only Tags name in IPTC keywords. I propose :
	  
	  ==> to check if a digiKam tags name already exist in database and
	  taging automaticly item using it.
	  ==> do nothing if Tags name do not exist (no new digiKam Tags
	  will be created in database).
	  ==> If dupplicate Tags name exist in digiKam database (for ex.
	  Travel/City and Travel/France/City), use only the first Tag name
	  found in database.
	  
	  digiKam Tags <==> IPTC Keywords rules is a complex problem.
	  Please give me your viewpoints into B.K.O. Thanks in advance

	  - New capability to copy metadata in clipboard like text.
	  - New capability to print metadata.
	  - Tags name use the "user Friendly" conversion from Exiv2 instead
	  the internal name provided by old Exif viewer based on libkexif.
	  - Capability to read metadata from CRW files (Canon RAW files)
	  - New class DMetadata to load/save metadata without loading image
	  data. Actually JPEG, CRW, and PNG files are supported. About PNG
	  (Exif and IPTC raw profiles generated by ImageMagick are
	  supported.
	  
	  To support new file formats (like NEF, MRW, TIFF, DNG, etc), new
	  image file parsers must be added to Exiv2 library.
	  
	  IMPORTANT:
	  
	  - Exiv2 do not support yet gettext for i18n rules. All
	  information in metadata viewers aren't yet i18n (tags name, tags
	  values, and tags descriptions)
	  - Any tag names use internal Exiv2 name, not the user friendly

	  - HSLMOdifier
	  - use mathematically simplified version of algorithm in
	  setLightness and setSaturation,
	  old version had integer overflows with 16 bit and rounding errors
	  - in setLightness, the value range was -200..200, while it is
	  -100..100 in setSaturation
	  and in the widget. Changed this to use range -100..100.
	  - use lround instead of truncating to int in BCGModifier,
	  HSLModifier
	  
	  Please test if the HSL filter now has the desired effect for both
	  8 bit and 16 bit.

	* libs/dimg/filters/bcgmodifier.cpp: digikam from trunk: rounding
	  error of BCG modifier
	  
	  With the current algorithm, even setting a gamma of 1.0 would
	  create
	  changes, (x / 255.0) * 255.0 might be slightly less than x, so
	  casting
	  this value to int would result in an error of 1.
	  I hope using the round() function is a correct fix for this,
	  at least the 1.0 value now creates a proper x=y mapping.

	  Factor" option for control panel dialog used in image editor
	  plugins.
	  
	  Current zoom factor are x1.0, x 1.5, x2.0, x2.5, x3.0. For any
	  memory performance reasons about to store image data in memory
	  (actually uncompressed), i have limited to 3.0 the max zoom
	  factor. This is enought normally...
	  
	  Before, Control Pannel dialog always displayed the image in x1.0.
	  Now, you can see zoom into the image all fine details like JPEG
	  artifacts or singular points (hot pixels for example) to correct
	  using image editor tools.
	  
	  Here we are a screenshot of "Restoration" plugin to correct JPEG
	  artifact using x2.5 zoom factor :
	  
	  http://digikam3rdparty.free.fr/Screenshots/digikam0.9.0-alpha5.png
	  
	  This commit fix any parts of the old implementation to optimize
	  memory using by the preview image data, especially with 16 bits
	  images. Any small bugs have been fixed about seperate view mode
	  rules.

	  - using DImg attribute "savedformat" to store the format of the
	  last saving operation,
	  set this attribute in all loaders that can save
	  - support re-using the current DImg of DImgInterface with a new
	  path and format,
	  set "format" to "savedformat"
	  - fix reusing the current DImg in ImageWindow and Showfoto,
	  update all labels
	  - rearrange ImageWindow::saveAsIsComplete: it is perfectly all
	  right for a user
	  to want to saveAs outside the album hierarchy, do not treat as an
	  error
	  - on error, in finishSaving, reset to previous image path
	  - use canSave rather than moreUndo for m_revertAction in
	  slotUndoStateChanged

	* utilities/imageeditor/canvas/dimginterface.cpp: - what I thought

	  is actually a feature of the BCGModifier
	  - only apply BCG in saving when the values were actually changed
	  - do not emit signalModified twice in undo/redo
	  
	  TODO:
	  There are inconsistencies.
	  changeGamma, changeBrightness, changeContrast, changeBCG emit
	  signalModified, but they do not modify the data, changes are
	  visible
	  when painted on canvas, but not on histogram.
	  setBCG acts like other methods, directly modifying the image

	  cursor,
	  now that all operations are asynchronous
	  - split signalChanged from a signal indicating a change in
	  undo/redo status
	  (now signalUndoRedoStateChange)
	  - slots in ImageWindow and Showfoto are split accordingly
	  - isReadOnly can be retrieved from Canvas/DImgInterface,
	  no need to pass it all the way through signals.
	  Added appropriate methods
	  - add extra check to avoid reentrancy in saving. Just for safety.
	  - what was setModified(false) is now clearUndoManager,
	  setModified(true)
	  is now setModified and used extensively inside DImgInterface
	  - in slotSavingFinished, reorder enabling actions a bit so that
	  the loading call can start
	  from a cleanly defined state
	  - saving is not a modification; do not emit signalModified.
	  - do not reload image after saving. Added code to saveIsComplete
	  to do what is done
	  in the loading slots except for actually loading
	  - setViewToURL
	  - not reloading implies that undo history is kept over saving.
	  - Formerly, the image did not need to be saved when undo history
	  was empty.
	  Now, a point of origin needs to be introduced to the undo manager
	  which identifies the state
	  that is identical to the file on disk.
	  - signalUndoRedoStateChange gets a third bool parameter.
	  - do not clear undo manager in DImgInterface when saving
	  - call LoadingCacheInterface::putImage to put the image into
	  cache in ImageWindow and showfoto
	  - In Canvas and DImgInterface, both save and saveAs were unused
	  and untested. Marked as deprecated,
	  renamed saveAsTmpFile to saveAs.
	  - ported DImgInterface to new putImage and bitBltImage methods of
	  DImg

	  - group data members of a DImg object:
	  - metadata
	  - image data (null, width, height, alpha, sixteenbit)
	  - data pointer
	  With imaging operations, the first group is always preserved, the
	  latter two may change
	  - add a few private methods for often reused code
	  - add a private constructor which copies metadata, but creates a
	  new data buffer with a new size,
	  used by copy and scale
	  - add a putImage method which replaces the data pointer and the
	  image data,
	  used by DImgInterface and thus the image plugins
	  - add a stripImageData method which allows to "strip" the data
	  off, take
	  ownership of the buffer, and leave the image as null. Useful for
	  temporary images.
	  - extend bitBlt to support source coordinates, width and height
	  parameters.
	  - add some flavors of the bitBltImage method, all using bitBlt in
	  the end
	  - use bitBlt for copy and crop to eliminate all the code doing
	  simple blitting operations
	  - add some comments in dimg files
	  - add a method metadata(DImg::METADATA) in analogy to attribute()
	  and embeddedText().

	  - PNG is now the perfect loosless GPL photograph container,
	  including all metadata from JPEG files (EXIF, IPTC, COM)
	  
	  The metadata are preserved using "Raw profiles" records in PNG
	  text tags. This technic come from ImageMagick tool and still
	  fully compatible with it and Perl::EXIFTool. Nothing is broken in
	  PNG to respect PNG compatibility with others sothwares/OS.
	  Existing PNG Raw profiles are listed at this url :
	  
	  http://search.cpan.org/src/EXIFTOOL/Image-ExifTool-5.87/html/TagNames/PNG.html#TextualData
	  
	  - Now digiKam can display Exif information embedded in PNG files
	  when a JPEG files have been converted to PNG using standard
	  'convert' ImageMagick tool or batch convert image kipi plugin
	  (this one using ImageMagick) ! Select a PNG file from your
	  photographs collection, enable Exif sidebar, and ENJOY...
	  
	  - With Image Editor, the metadata are preserved in these
	  workflows : JPEG -> PNG and PNG -> JPEG.
	  
	  TODO :
	  
	  - Add a conversion on the fly with digiKam camera GUI. Actually,
	  it's very easy to do JPEG/RAW -> PNG conversion with metadata
	  backup.
	  RAW Exif metadata can be get using THM files from USM cameras
	  (already tested with my Dynax 5D)...
	  - Find the right (and simple) way to get EXIF/IPTC metada from
	  TIFF/EP file like libJpeg can provide (using a simple ByteArray
	  copy). If there is a TIFF _GURU_ in this room, any help welcome
	  !!!

	  - threaded image loading
	  - add SharedLoadSaveThread class
	  - split declarations to different header files
	  - add LoadingCache class
	  - sharing of loading processes: if an image is currently being
	  loaded in another
	  SharedLoadSaveThread, a second thread will wait for the first to
	  finish
	  instead of loading it twice
	  - caching of images: loaded images are cached and available to
	  subsequent requests
	  This should eliminate any unnecessary work.
	  - Histogram tab
	  - adapt to shared loading
	  - remove some repaints
	  - painting progress message only after timeout value (100 ms),
	  much snappier now
	  - fixed display of loading failure
	  - Image Editor and Showfoto
	  - adapt DImgInterface to threaded image loading
	  - add appropriate signals and slots to all three layers
	  (DImgInterface, Canvas, ImageWindow and Showfoto)
	  - split loading and saving functions in two parts in all three
	  layers
	  - for saving, some information needs to be stored across
	  asynchronous calls which
	  was previously stored in local variables.
	  Added appropriate members respectively SavingContext classes (in
	  ImageWindow, Showfoto).
	  - put in hooks for progress info display
	  - added preliminary code to wait on asynchronous saving, needed
	  for promptUserSave()
	  - added a modal progress dialog
	  - needs to be tested and fixed, see TODO below
	  - fix creation of ImageWindow singleton upon exiting
	  (checking for imageWindow() would create the instance if not yet
	  done)
	  
	  TODO:
	  - add progress display to status bar
	  - disable actions when saving (all actions?) and loading (not all
	  actions,
	  e.g. selecting another image must be possible and abort loading)
	  - test, think about and fix waiting on save() in promptUserSave()
	  - more thorough testing
	  - fix a bug when fast switching through list in IE. First add
	  disabling of actions.
	  - still some debug statements active

	  utilities/imageeditor/editor/imagewindow.cpp: Digikam from trunk
	  : and finally RAW file decoding settings are now used by IE and
	  Showfoto...
	  
	  Actually, the RAW file decoding settings implementation provide
	  these parameters :
	  
	  - Enable Quality Decoding (bool) : If disable, we using old dcraw
	  command line syntax with '-q' parameter alone. If Enable we using
	  addition quality factor require by last dcraw release.
	  - Quality Decoding Factor (int 0-4) : The famous factor using to
	  optimize RAW decoding image (0 for slow computer, 3 for speed
	  computer)
	  
	  TO DIGIKAM TEAM :
	  
	  - I have tested using this implementation using dcraw v7.49, not
	  the last one released by Dave Coffin.
	  - We can add any other advanced RAW decoding parameter on
	  settings dialog tab :
	  * -f : Interpolate RGB as four colors. This blurs the image a
	  little, but it eliminates false 2x2 mesh patterns.
	  * -a : Automatic color balance. The default is to use a fixed
	  color balance based on a white card photographed in sunlight.
	  * -w : Use the color balance specified by the camera. If this
	  can't be found, dcraw prints a warning and reverts to the
	  default.
	  * -n : By default, dcraw clips all colors to prevent pink hues in
	  the highlights. Combine this option with -b 0.25 to leave the
	  image data completely unclipped.
	  * -j : For Fuji Super CCD cameras, show the image tilted 45
	  degrees so that each output pixel corresponds to one raw pixel.
	  * -s : For Fuji Super CCD SR cameras, use the secondary sensors,
	  in effect underexposing the image by four stops to reveal detail
	  in the highlights. For all other cameras, -j and -s are silently
	  ignored.
	  
	  Notes :
	  
	  - "-a" and "-w" are always actually enable on the current
	  implementation and work fine. I'm not sure if ti's a good idea to
	  disable these parameters.
	  - I have never tested "-f" parameter. I think this one must be
	  availabe in setup.
	  - "-n", "-j", and "-s" are indeep settings. i'm not favorable to
	  add these options, excepted if any users want these parameters...
	  
	  Please let's me hear if all is right for you ! Suggestions and
	  wishes are welcome

	  This implementation use a new class from digiKam core library
	  name threadimageio dedicaced to perform load and saving
	  operations on image files. This class has been written by Marcel
	  Wiesweg.
	  
	  In first, i have use this class to perform loading image on main
	  window histogram sidebar tab. The old implementation performed
	  loading in GUI thread that generated any time latency.
	  Now loading operations are separated and GUI isn't frozen.
	  
	  TODO :
	  
	  - To load RAW files DImg image loader use parce.c implementation
	  from dcraw project. This source code using a lot of 'printf' to
	  debug. This is wrong and generate any time latency problem. We
	  need to fix it in the future, especially to port dcraw code to a
	  dedicaced pure C++ class.
	  - Add progress to DImg image loader.
	  - Fix DImg image loader implementation to break an image io
	  currently performed.
	  - Add thread image io support in Image editor Canvas.
	  - Add progress indicator in Image Editor canvas. We no need to
	  use a progress bar here, just a text indicator in percent placed
	  at canvas center. Like this, image editor layout isn't broken.
	  
	  Thanks to Marcel to help me in these task !

	  This is the new code dedicaced to 0.9.0 unstable developement
	  branch!!!
	  digiKam users, please take a care...
	  
	  Core:
	  
	  ==> New image properties sidebar implementation to display exif,
	  histogram, and image comments & tags to the left of windows using
	  sidebar.
	  This way remove all image properties dialogs and reduce main
	  contextual popup menu (BUG 109096, 109817, 109992, 113103).
	  
	  ==> New DImg framework to work "à la QImage" with image in 8/16
	  bits/color/pixel(BUG 103176).
	  The code is based on incomplete DImage implementation from Renchi
	  Raju. I had fixed and improved this one.
	  Native file formats implemented are JPEG, PNG, TIFF, RAW (dcraw),
	  PPM.
	  ICC profils and Meta-data are preserved. lcms is used to manage
	  colors rendering manually or automaticly (BUG 87823).
	  Now, There is a new digiKam depency with lcms.
	  
	  Showfoto:
	  
	  - Image properties sidebar support
	  - All images from a folder can be loaded at the same time.
	  - Add DImg support.
	  - Thumbbar moved to the left. Image properties side bar to the
	  right to make a consistant GUI with digikam window.
	  
	  Image Editor:
	  
	  - Image properties sidebar support
	  - Add DImg support.
	  
	  PENDING TASK:
	  
	  - DImg : add cache file method to improve loading operations.
	  - DImg : add metadata transfert rules between file formats.
	  - DImg : add native support of JPEG2000, OpenEXR, and Krita file
	  formats.
	  - DImg : add rules to detect camera type use to take a photo and
	  applying automaticly an ICC profil (RAW file formats especially).
	  - DImg : add Load/save operation in separed thread to unfreeze
	  GUI.
	  - Image Editor : add progress bar during load/save operation
	  (depending of precedent point)
	  - Image Editor : add Events support between IE and main window
	  about comments & tag sidebar
	  - Core : porting all imageplugins to DImg and support 16 bits
	  images (actually only BCG tool is ported).
	  - Core : porting all image filters to 16 bits (histogram, curves,
	  color effects, etc.)
	  - Core : Saving digiKam comments in PNG & TIFF files like JPEG.
	  - Core : Removed imlib2 depency.
	  - Setup : add new configuration dialog tab to set ICC profils
	  management.
	  - DigikamImagePlugins : porting all plugins to DImg and support
	  16 bits images. All plugins work fine in 8 bits.
	  - DigikamImagePlugins : add new plugin to apply manually an ICC
	  profil.
	  
	  All contributors welcome to finalize digiKam 0.9.0...

	  You can rmb click to that root album to add a new child to the

	  Digikam doesn't allow images to be stored in the root folder.

	* Undo for digiKam image-editor. The undo-stack design is very
	  simple: actions
	  are either reversible (rotate,flip) or irreversible (rest of the
	  actions
	  and all of the plugin actions). The reversible undos are
	  implemented by just
	  saving the commands and for the irreversible undos image copies
	  are saved
	  into a temporary database.
	  
	  At some later stage, this will be improved and redos & "History

	  of

	* * reworked the image painting routines:
	  - the painting is done onto pixmaps tiles which
	  are cached
	  - tile size is 512x512 (surprisingly the speed of
	  the scaling routines in imlib2 tends to scale
	  non-linearly, i.e. its much faster to render one big
	  tile than a bunch of small ones). that's why such
	  a big tile size. at most 20 tiles are cached at one
	  time.
	  - tile updating and painting is done on demand - expose,
	  paint, cache
	  - fixes glitches in the painting
	  * minor change: the blended color has been changed to a
	  shade of grey with slightly more opaqueness. i have found
	  this color to be more usable than the previous darker blend

	* * Added an item ("Set as Album Thumbnail") to the context menu in
	  the thumbnail
	  view to select a particular image as the album thumbnail - to let
	  the user choose
	  his own thumbnails for the albums.
	  
	  * Furthermore I've changed the album thumbnail creation
	  completely. The image path,
	  from which the album thumbnail was created is now stored in the
	  digikam database.
	  
	  To create these new album icons, the user has to browse through
	  his albums. The
	  first readable image will be used as the default icon. Then he
	  can change the
	  album thumbnail to an images he likes (with the context menu as
	  described above).
	  This is not the best solution to create the new thumbnails, but
	  we decided not to
	  add too much special code to the application which is only needed
	  for the first
	  run after an upgrade.

	* double-click/return-press will open up the imageviewer for the
	  camera file
	  items

2004-07-25 07:24  pahlibar

	* Disable saving of images when viewing a camera file in the image
	  editor.
	  User can still use saveas to save the file elsewhere. at some
	  point,
	  we have to start thinking of allowing user to save the file and
	  the file
	  gets uploaded back into the camera. maybe too much of a hassle
	  for an
	  infrequently used operation

2004-07-25 07:05  pahlibar

	* implemented viewing image

2004-07-25 04:16  pahlibar

	* * added: retrieve and show camera information

2004-07-25 03:21  pahlibar

	* slowly adding back all the old features from the
	  digikamcameraclient

	* * if thumbnail can't be loaded from database, delete the key
	  * safety checks: check if db is valid

2004-07-23 23:33  pahlibar

	* "instant loading" thumbnails aka ACDSee-here-we-come
	  
	  * creates a database file (gdbm database) in ~/.thumbnails
	  * adds a tiny low resolution (48x48) thumbnail for each file in
	  the album
	  that you browse to using digikam
	  * on loading an album, this database is queried to see if a
	  thumbnail is
	  present for a file and if yes, this thumbnail is loaded, rough
	  scaled to
	  the size needed and shown.
	  * the regular thumbnail loader runs in the background, as usual,
	  and it
	  keeps updating the displayed thumbnails, essentially smoothing
	  the
	  thumbnails.
	  * result is that if the user visits an album which he/she has
	  browsed to
	  before, the rough thumbnail are shown fast and then the smoothing
	  process
	  of the thumbnails begin.
	  * regular thumbnails are still stored according to the
	  freedesktop standards

2004-07-23 22:24  pahlibar

	* * set the cursor to a busy cursor when loading images.
	  * semi-progressive painting of the images when flipping between
	  images. essentially what it does is splits the painting of the
	  image into
	  multiple small paints (stripwise). used only when loading an
	  image and not
	  while scrolling/zooming/... . scrolling through images should be
	  non-blocking and seem a bit faster
	  * preload next image (not really sure it helps since rendering is
	  the
	  most expensive part and we do not do any rendering in the
	  preload)
	  * fixed a painting bug when resizing the selection with handles

2004-07-23 10:37  cgilles

2004-07-21 00:38  pahlibar

	* Updated TODO

2004-07-21 00:07  pahlibar

	* optimization for loading items in a tag (especially recursively).
	  seems
	  queries on sqlite when using JOIN tables is rather slow. by
	  building
	  the album list manually and then querying items from the tag
	  table alone,
	  the queries are much faster (nearly 10x speed increase).
	  consequently
	  listing of items from the tags has a >2x speed increase (stating
	  and
	  listentry slow things down).

	* CCMAIL: digikam-devel@lists.sourceforge.net,
	  digikam-users@lists.sourceforge.net
	  
	  Waiting-for-your-backtraces AKA first-steps-to-0.7 commit
	  
	  Large number of changes:
	  a) interfaces subdirectory removed. some of the code moved to
	  digikam subdir
	  b) sqlite source code (v2.8.14) imported into a separate subdir
	  c) AlbumManager/AlbumDB/Album (note: change in name from
	  AlbumInfo->Album)
	  rewritten from scratch
	  d) AlbumDB is the new sqlite based database backend instead of
	  the old xml
	  style database. Old xml database will be imported automatically
	  into
	  the new database. No export function yet (do we still need a
	  separate
	  digikam xml format? we can think of exporting to some other app
	  format,
	  like kimdaba/kphotobook). Note: the old xml files are still
	  retained,
	  so you can safely run this new digikam on your existing album
	  library.
	  e) Album is an abstract class with derived implementations of two
	  (currently)
	  kinds: Physical Albums (PAlbum) - representing folders on the
	  drive and
	  Tag Album (TAlbum) - representing tags in the database
	  f) Nested albums supported (some optimization might be needed for
	  loading
	  the initial list of physical albums). both folders and tags can
	  have
	  unlimited nesting
	  g) Native light-weight implementation of a treeview to replace
	  qlistview
	  based treeview. this new implementation is flicker-free and has a
	  cleaner
	  look compared to qlistview
	  h) Tagging of images added (you must have guessed it from the
	  above statements).
	  Tags are shown as "albums" under a subtree of the treeview on the
	  left.
	  Tagging can be done individually for an image using a dialog
	  (enhanced version
	  of the old comments dialog) or in bulk by selecting a bunch of
	  images and
	  dragging and dropping on a tag.
	  i) rewrite of the painting routines by getting information from
	  the database
	  diretly instead of loading it into memory. thumbnail items have a
	  fixed
	  grid size and text not fitting into the grid will be shown
	  truncated with dots.
	  (need to add a tooltip for this)
	  f) extra information that can be shown in the thumbnail view:
	  name (yes, name is hideable), date, file size, resolution,
	  comments,
	  jpeg comments, tags. removed items: Exif comments and mimetype
	  g) lots more. i will add them to the ChangeLog as and when i
	  remember them
	  
	  Caveats:
	  a) KIPI interface is commented out. A port to the new digikam
	  classes will
	  need to be done. So no kipi plugins will be loaded
	  b) Camera Client disabled (won't be compiled). A custom folder
	  selection/creation dialog is needed before it can be enabled
	  again.
	  c) There might (very likely) be regressions. Polishing is need on
	  a lot
	  of aspects.
	  c) this is a massive upgrade. so things are bound to have broken.
	  Testing
	  is requested.

	  1) Zooming should be much faster (and use considerably less

	  one.
	  we take advantage of imlib2 speed (and cache use) and render from
