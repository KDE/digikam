post 1.0.0 mvc merge
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * model for the image view in cameraui
 * port thumbbar

Is this really needed?
 * sorting albums by something else than name (date, category)
   http://steveire.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/testing-proxy-models-gets-easier-again/
 
Later:
 * decide which additional sidebar handling code currently placed in digikamview
   should be moved to the sidebar class directly
 * DEFINITELY clean up the project structure. It's absolutely not obvious which
   file depends on which atm
 * There are a few derived album tree views mainly to provide only another
   context menu. It would be better to have strategy objects for handling
   the context menu. These strategies could be used as decorators to allow
   a more flexible sorting mechanism for menu entries.

1.0.0 TODO LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* right hand side sidebar (allee):
	o Select an album 
        o click on some empty space in the thumbnail view (-> selected image changes from blue selection
          background to dotted line (aka still has keyboard focus, right?)
        o Now select tabs in right hand side:
		+ Properties, metadata..: everyhing is disabled
		+ comments/tags tab on the other hand  shows info about the image with keyboard focus
        Shouldn't every tab show now it's info in this case? (alternatively disable comments/tags too)

* ImageEditor:

   - Polish keyboard focus in sidebar when navigate between album pictures.


* B.K.O files to fix :

==> 113797 : Main interface : Little thumbnail refresh problem. 

* Media support:

    o Testing 3 plug cases with GPhoto camera
        1) digikam is not running and camera is pluged in
            -> media action dialog pops up and digikam should
               be in the list. 
        2) digikam is already running when camera is plug in
            -> as 1) but already instance should be used
            (uniconize, switchToDesktop and bringToFront applied
            if necessary
        3) digikam is started/activated after action dialog was closed and
           camera is already connected
            -> camera menu allows to 
                select the 'dynamicly added camera menu item
                to start download dialog
                ditto for unmounting in usm case
